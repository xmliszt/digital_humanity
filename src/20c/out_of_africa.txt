The lithe slender figure that moves through the pages of this
book needs no mtroduction. Small though she is on the vast
landscape about which she writes, she reveals herself with
clarity and deftness. Her joys and dreams and hours of tragic
gloom she never dwells upon. But when you have finished
Chit of Africa you know Isak Dinesen with an intensity and '
depth of understanding far surpassing your knowledge of
the people who make up much of your daily life.

It would also be presumptuous to try to add a word to her.
picture of the East African highlands. Before your eyes as
you read stretch the great plains where black men live and
wild beasts roam — along the equator and into the shadow' of
snow-capped volcano peaks. The white man’s life, scattered
and transitory for the most part, is only a thin top layer super-
imposed upon the primitive old continent. Under Isak Dine-
sen’s spell you hear beneath the deep steady heartbeat. It was
here she made her home through the most exciting impres-
sionable years of her life, and her memories, born of passion
and tenderness, recreate that distant scene for- all time. The
last shining phrase has been uttered.

1 hen too, introductions, or intrusions by any other name,
being pronouncements by persons who have already read the
book, belong logically at the end. Only if the book has been
rewarding— only then — does the reader want to know Who
is Sylvia? What is she? So this time, if Out of Africa still lies
open after you have finished reading it, if you cannot bear to
close it, you might then turn back to these early pages, to
find out what has happened since in Kenya.

In the winter of 1951 I traveled 19,888 miles by airplane,
because I had read Out of Africa. Others must have done it
too. For never has there been such a book to capture the
imagination. I read it when jt came out in 1938, and the seed
of desire, planted then, had taken root and grown deep. In no
other book I know— even remembering Joseph Conrad— is
there the glow that shines through Out of Africa. You are
transported to a land as remote as the moon; huge pachyderms,
from another eon wander there freely; and dark narrow-
headed tribesmen become your familiars. You are on a
continent as it was ten million years ago, yet vibrant and
exhilarating.

I was lured to British East Africa because it was there, in
the highlands of Kenya Colony, that Isak Dinesen lived for
seventeen years, ran her coffee farm, and became a legend.
In those parts she is known by her real name, Karen Blixen.

I saw Ae animals she writes about, the elephants “pacing
along as if they had an appointment at the end of the world,”
the rhinos sniffing and snorting in the air of davra, the gentle
ambling giraffes. The big animals are still there, but with the
encroachments of man they have moved noiselessly away
from the parts where Karen Blixen knew them. The natives I
saw were no doubt children of those she knew so well, tall,
slim, dark and dark-eyed, “Africa in flesh and blood.’’ The
chauffeur who drove ys was of the tribe she knew hect- a

zii



Kikuyu, with long lacy ears that drooped near to his shoul-
ders. Nairobi, the town to which she used to ride on horse-
back or in a cart pulled by six mules, is still a frontier town,
but its old corrugated-iron shops are fast giving way to
modern concrete. Military delegates from Europe, meeting
there on problems of defense, rub shoulders with Masai
warriors.

It was not long ago that it all happened. The great 6000-acre
coffee farm which Karen Blixen administered alone w^as sold
only in 1931. Many of her friends still live in Kenya, and
even to those who did not know her, the name is familiar.
The big farm is now Karen Estate, a suburb of Nairobi, and
her house — Karen House — is its center. Some of her old
servants still come from time to time and ask permission to
walk about the grounds. But Farah, the faithful old Somali,,
is dead, and Kamante is nearly blind.

Near the western wall of her house was an old millstone
made into a table. It is still there. Frequently old Kinanjui sat
there, the big chief of the Kikuyus, spreading himself on a
chair, naked but for the mantle of blue monkey furs on his
shoulders, an old native, “clod of the soil of the African high-
lands.” He came to discuss with her matters of importance to
his tribe. There she and Denys Finch-Hatton had, one New
Year, seen the new moon and the planets of Venus and Jupiter
all close together in a group in the sky.

As she tells about the people who lived on the farm and
those who came there to visit, she pauses long over each; she
remembers with care, so that we too know them well.

Denys Finch-Hatton had no other home in Africa than the
farm, and he lived in her house between his safaris. “When
he came back to the farm, it gave out what was in it; it spoke.”
“When Denys and I went for a ride, the lions of the plains
would be about, as in attendance. We would come upon them



at a meal, or see them crossing the dry river-beds.” Inter-
woven into the fabric of the book are the strands of her
beautiful tribute to him. Many of the present-day white
hunters, of whom he had formerly been one, knew him and
worked with him. Everyone who lived there in those days
speaks of the rare charm of the Etonian English man who
made Africa his own land.

Denys liked to hear her tell a story, and when she told one,
the natives clustered about to listen. As she says, she might
have cut a figure at the time of the plague of Florence. And
Jhose of us who have read Seven Gothic Tales and Winter’s
'Tales can see how it would have been. To the natives’ de-
light she sometimes made rhymes. When she finished tfiey
;bcgged: “^peak again. Speak like rain.”

It was not long ago. But Karen Blixen herself is now far
away in Denmark, and her years on the African highlands are
isolated in time and space. For a writer, what an extraordinary
.set of circumstances it is to have had such a profound experi-
ence, so long-lasting, so far removed from the world of the
•civilized, so active and effective personally, so deeply emo-
tional, and then to see it in perspective while still young and
.at the height of her powers! Paradise for a time was hers, and
with her eyes open and all senses aware, she saw it lost. On his
rieathbed she had to deny the old chief, Kinanjui, who trusted
her; Denys crashed in his airplane and was killed, and all
Kenya mourned; she had to sell her farm, and see her people
stuttered. It all happened within a few months. It was para-
dise lost indeed.

I reread Out of Africa when I got home. And even though
the land and people had changed, the book had gained a
hundredfold. There was a tender wistfulness I had not recog-
nized before, and the salt taste of tears. Only then did I fully
understand the burning nostalgia which possessed Karen

xiv



Blixen when she wrote the book, for to a small degree I
shared it.

“If I know a song of Africa — of the Giraffe, and the
African new moon lying on her back, of the ploughs in the
fields, and the sweaty faces of the coffee-pickers, does
Africa know a song of me? Would the air over the plain
quiver with a colour that I had had on, or the children in-
vent a game in which my name was, or the full moon throw
a shadow over the gravel of the drive that was like me, or
would the eagles of the Ngong hills look out for me?”

Yes, a thousand times yes, one wants to say. But who knows
the heart and memory of Africa?

^ had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills.

The Equator runs across these highlands, a hundred
miles to the North, and the farm lay at an altitude of over
six thousand feet. In the day-time you felt that you had got
high up, near to the sun, but the early mornings and eve-
nings were limpid and restful, and the nights were cold.

The geographical position, and the height of the land
combined to create a landscape that had not its like in all the
world. There was no fat on it and no luxuriance anywhere;
it was Africa distilled up through six thousand feet, like the
strong and refined essence of a continent. The colours were
dry and burnt, like the colours in pottery. The trees had a
light delicate foliage, the structure of which was different
from that of the trees in Europe; it did not grow in bows or
cupolas, but in horizontal layers, and the formation gave to
the tall solitary trees a likeness to the palms, or a heroic and
romantic air like fullrigged ships with their sails clewed up,
and to the edge of a wood a strange appearance as if the whole
wood were faintly vibrating. Upon the grass of the great
plains the crooked bare old thorn-trees were scattered, and
the grass was spiced like thyme and bog-myrtle; in some
places the scent was so strong, that it smarted in the nostrils.



OUT OF AFRICA

All the flowers that you found on the plains, or upon the
creepers and liana in the native forest, were diminutive like
flowers of the downs,— only just in the beginning of the long
rains a number of big, massive heavy-scented lilies sprang
out on the plains. The views were immensely wide. Every-
thing that you saw made for greatness and freedom, and un-
equalled nobility.

The chief feature of the landscape, and of your life in it,
was the air. Looking back on a sojourn in the African high-
lands, you are struck by your feeling of having lived for a
time up in the air. The sky was rarely more than pale blue
or violet, with a profusion of mighty, weightless, ever-
changing clouds towering up and sailing on it, but it has a
blue vigour in it, and at a short distance it painted the ranges
of hills and the woods a fresh deep blue. In the middle of
the day the air was alive over the land, like a flame burning;
it scintillated, waved and shone like running water, mirrored
and doubled all objects, and created great Fata Morgana. Up
in this high air you breathed easily, drawing in a vital as-
surance and lightness of heart. In the highlands you woke up
in the morning and thought: Here I am, where I ought to be.

The Mountain of Ngong stretches in a long ridge from
North to South, and is crowned with four noble peaks like
immovable darker blue waves against the sky. It rises eight
thousand feet above the Sea, and to the East two thousand
feet above the surrounding country; but to the West the
drop is deeper and more precipitous,— the hills fall vertically
down towards the Great Rift Valley.

The wind in the highlands blows steadily from the North-
North-East. It is the same wind that, down at the coasts of
Africa and Arabia, they name the Monsoon, the East Wind,
which was King Solomon’s favourite horse. Up here it is felt

4



KAMANTE AND LULL


as just the resistance of the air, as the Earth throws herself
forward into space. The wind runs straight against the
Ngong Hills, and the slopes of the hills would be the ideal
place for setting up a glider, that would be lifted upwards
by the currents, over the mountain top. The clouds, which
were travelling with the wind, struck the side of the hill and
hung round it, or were caught on the summit and broke into
rain. But those that took a higher course and sailed clear of
the reef, dissolved to the West of it, over the burning desert
of the Rift Valley. Many times I have from my house fol-
lowed these mighty processions advancing, and have won-
dered to see their proud floating masses, as soon as they had
got over the hills, vanish in the blue air and be gone.

The hills from the farm changed their character many
times in the course of the day, and sometimes looked quite
close, and at other times very far away. In the evening, when
it was getting dark, it would first look, as you gazed at them,
as if in the sky a thin silver line was drawn all along the sil-
houette of the dark mountain; then, as night fell, the four
peaks seemed to be flattened and smoothened out, as if the
mountain was stretching and spreading itself.

From the Ngong Hills you have a unique view, you see to
the South the vast plains of the great game-country that
stretches all the way to Kilimanjaro; to the East and North
the park-like country of the foot-hills with the forest behind
them, and the undulating land of the Kikuyu-Reserve, which
extends to Mount Kenya a hundred miles away,— a mosaic
of little square maize-fields, banana-groves and grass-land,
with here and there the blue smoke from a native village, a
small cluster of peaked mole-casts. But towards the West,
deep down, lies the dry, moon-like landscape of the African
low country. The brown desert is irregularly dotted with
the little marks of the thornbushes, the winding river-beds

OUT OF AFRICA

are drawn up with crooked dark-green trails; those are the
woods of the mighty, wide-branching Mimosa-trees, with
thorns like spikes; the cactus grows here, and here is the
home of the Giraffe and the Rhino.

The hill-country itself, when you get into it, is tremen-
dously big, picturesque and mysterious; varied with long
valleys, thickets, green slopes and rocky crags. High up,
under one of the peaks, there is even a bamboo-grove. There
are springs and wells in the hills; I have camped up here by
them.

In my day, the Buffalo, the Eland and the Rhino lived in
the Ngong Hills,— the very old Natives remembered a time
when there were Elephants there,— and I was always sorry
that the whole Ngong Mountain was not enclosed in the
Game Reserve. Only a small part of it was Game Reserve,
and the beacon on the Southern peak marked the boundary
of it. When the Colony prospers and Nairobi, the capital,
grows into a big city, the Ngong Hills might have made a
matchless game park for it. But during my last years in
Africa many young Nairobi shop-people ran out into the
hills on Sundays, on their motor-cycles, and shot at any-
thing they saw, and I believe that the big game will have
wandered away from the hills, through the thorn-thickets
and the stony ground further South.

Up on the very ridge of the hills and on the four peaks
themselves it was easy to walk; the grass was short as on a
lawn, with the grey stone in places breaking through the
sward. Along the ridge, up and down the peaks, like a gentle
switchback, there ran a narrow game-path. One morning, at
the time that I was camped in the hills, I came up here and
walked along the path, and I found on it fresh tracks and
dung of a herd of Eland. The big peaceful animals must
have been up on the ridge at sunrise, walking in a long row^

and you eannot imagine that they had come for any other
reason than just to look, deep down on both sides, at the
land below.

We grew coffee on my farm. The land was in itself a little
too high for coffee, and it was hard work to keep it going;
we were never rich on the farm. But a coffee-plantation is
a thing that gets hold of you and does not let you go, and
there is always something to do on it: you are generally just
a little behind with your work.

In the wildness and irregularity of the country, a piece of
land laid out and planted according to rule, looked very
well. Later on, when I flew in Africa, and became familiar
with the appearance of my farm from the air, I was filled
with admiration for my coffee-plantation, that lay quite
bright green in the grey-green land, and I realized how
keenly the human mind yearns for geometrical figures. All
the country round Nairobi, particularly to the North of the
town, is laid out in a similar way, and here lives a people,
who are constantly thinking and talking of planting, prun-
ing or picking coffee, and who lie at night and meditate
upon improvements to their coffee-factories.

Coffee-growing is a long job. It does not all come out as
you imagine, when, yourself young and hopeful, in the
streaming rain, you carry the boxes of your shining young
coffee-plants from the nurseries, and, with the whole num-
ber of farm-hands in the field, watch the plants set in the
regular rows of holes in the wet ground where they are to
grow, and then have them thickly shaded against the sun,
with branches broken from the bush, since obscurity is the
privilege of young things. It is four or five years till the trees
come into bearing, and in the meantime you will get drought
on the laud, or diseases, and the bold native weeds will

OUT OF AFRICA

grow up thick in the fields,— the black-jack, which has long
scabrous seed-vessels that hang on to your clothes and
stockings. Some of the trees have been badly planted with
their tap-roots bent; they will die just as they begin to
flower. You plant a little over six hundred trees to the acre,
and I had six hundred acres of land with coffee; my oxen
dragged the cultivators up and down the fields, between
die rows of trees, many thousand miles, patiently, awaiting
coming bounties.

There are times of great beauty on a coffee-farm. When
the plantation flowered in the beginning of the rains, it was
a radiant sight, like a cloud of chalk, in the mist and the
drizzling rain, over six hundred acres of land. The coffee-
blossom has a delicate slightly bitter scent, like the black-
thorn blossom. When the field reddened with the ripe ber-
ries, all the women and the children, whom they call the
Totos, were called out to pick the coffee off the trees, to-
gether with the men; then the waggons and carts brought
it down to the factory near the river. Our machinery was
never quite what it should have been, but we had planned
and built the factory ourselves and thought highly of it.
Once the whole factory burned down and had to be built up
again. The big coffee-dryer turned and turned, rumbling
the coffee in its iron belly with a sound like pebbles that are
washed about on the sea-shore. Sometimes the coffee would
be dry, and ready to take out of the dryer, in the middle of
the night. That was a picturesque moment, with many hur-
ricane lamps in the huge dark room of the factory, that was
hung everywhere with cobwebs and coffee-husks, and with
eager glowing dark faces, in the light of the lamps, round
the dryer; the factory, you felt, hung in the great African
night like a bright jewel in an Ethiope’s ear. Later on the
8



KAMANTE AND LULU


coffee was hulled, graded and sorted, by hand, and packed
in sacks sewn up with a saddler’s needle.

Then in the end in the early morning, while it was still
dark, and I was lying in bed, I heard the waggons, loaded
high up with coffee-sacks, twelve to a ton, with sixteen oxen
to each waggon, starting on their way in to Nairobi railway
station up the long factory hill, with much shouting and
rattling, the drivers running beside the waggons. I was pleased
to think that this was the only hill up, on their way, for the
farm was a thousand feet higher than the town of Nairobi.
In the evening I walked out to meet the procession that
came bade, the tired oxen hanging their heads in front of
the empty waggons, with a tired little Toto leading them,
and the weary drivers trailing their whips in the dust of the
road. Now we had done what we could do. The coffee
would be on the sea in a day or two, and we could only
hope for good luck at the big auction-sales in London.

I had six thousand acres of land, and had thus got much
spare land besides the coffee-plantation. Part of the farm
was native forest, and about one thousand acres were squat-
ters’ land, what they called their shambas. The squatters are
Natives, who with their families hold a few acres on a white
man’s farm, and in return have to work for him a certain
number of days in the year. My squatters, I think, saw the
relationship in a different light, for many of them were born
on the farm, and their fathers before them, and they very
likely regarded me as a sort of superior squatter on their
estates. The squatters’ land was more intensely alive than
the rest of the farm, and was changing with the seasons the
year round. The maize grew up higher than your head as
you walked on the narrow hard-trampled footpaths in be-
tween the tall green rustling regiments, and then again it
was harvested. The beans ripened in the fields, were gathered

0



OUT OF AFRICA

and thrashed by the women, and the stalks and pods were
collected and burned, so that in certain seasons thin blue
columns of smoke rose here and there all over the farm.
The Kikuyu also grew the sweet potatoes, that have a vine-
like leaf and spread over the ground like a dense entangled
mat, and many varieties of big yellow and green speckled
pumpkins.

Whenever you walk amidst the Kikuyu shambas, the first
thing that will catch your eye is the hind part of a little old
woman raking in her soil, like a picture of an pstrich which
buries her head in the sand. Each Kikuyu family had a num-
ber of small round peaked huts and store-huts; the space
between the huts was a lively place, the earth hard as con-
crete; here the maize was ground and the goats milked, and
children and chickens were running. I used to shoot spur-
fowl in the sweet-potato fields round the squatters’ houses
in the blue late afternoons, and the stock-pigeons cooed out
a loud song in the high-stemmed, fringy trees, which were
left over, here and there in the shambas, from the forest
that had once covered all the farm.

I had moreover a couple of thousand acres of grass-land
on the farm. Here the long grass ran and fled like sea-waves
before the strong wind, and the little Kikuyu herdboys
herded their fathers’ cows. In the cold season they carried
live coals in small wicker baskets with them from the huts,
and sometimes caused big grass-fires, which were disastrous
to the grazing on the farm. In the years of drought the
Zebra and the Eland came down to the farm’s grass-plains.

Nairobi was our town, twelve miles away, down on a flat
bit of land amongst hills. Here were the Government House
and the big central ofiices; from here the country was ruled.

It is impossible that a town will not play a part in your
10



KAMANTE AND LULU


life, it does not even make much difference whether you
have more good or bad things to say of it, it draws your
mind to it, by a mental law of gravitation. The luminous
haze on the sky above the town at night, which I could see
from some places on my farm, set my thoughts going, and
recalled the big cities of Europe.

When I first came to Africa, there were no cars in the
country, and we rode in to Nairobi, or drove in a cart with
six mules to it, and stabled our animals in the stables of The
Highland Transport, During all my time, Nairobi was a
motley place, with some fine new stone buildings, and
whole quarters of old corrugated iron shops, offices and
bungalows, laid out with long rows of Eucalyptus trees
along the bare dusty streets. The Offices of the High Court,
the Native Affairs Department, and the Veterinary Depart-
ment were lousily housed, and I had a great respect for
those Government Officials, who could get any work at all
done in the little burning hot, inky rooms in which they
were set.

All the same Nairobi was a town; here you could buy
things, hear news, lunch or dine at the hotels and dance at
the Club. And it was a live place, in movement like running
water, and in growth like a young thing, it changed from
year to year, and while you were away on a shooting Safari.
The new Government House was built, a stately cool house
with a fine ball-room and a pretty garden, big hotels grew
up, great impressive agricultural shows and fine flower
shows were held, our Quasi Smart Set of the Colony from
time to time enlivened the town with rows of quick melo-
drama. Nairobi said to you: “Make the most of me and of
time. Wir kommen nie wieder so jung— so undisciplined and
rapacious— zusammen.” Generally I and Nairobi were in
very good understanding, and at one time I drove through



OUT OF AFRICA

the town and thought: There is no world without Nairobi’s
streets.

The quarters of the Natives and of the coloured immi-
grants were very extensive compared to the European town.

The Swaheli town, on the road to the Muthaiga Club,
had not a good name in any way, but was a lively, dirty
and gaudy place, with, at any hour, a number of things
going on in it. It was built mostly out of old paraffin tins
hammered flat, in various states of rust, like the coral rock,
the fossilized structure, from which the spirit of the ad-
vancing civilization was steadily fleeing.

The Somali town was farther away from Nairobi, on ac-
count, I think, of the Somali’s system of seclusion of their
women. There were in my day a few beautiful young
Somali women, of whom all the town knew the names, who
went and lived in the Bazaar and led the Nairobi Police a
great dance; they were intelligent, and bewitching people.
But the honest Somali women were not seen in the town.
The Somali town lay exposed to all winds and was shadeless
and dusty, it must have recalled to the Somali their native
deserts. Europeans, who live for a long time, even for sev-
eral generations, in the same place, cannot reconcile them-
selves to the complete indifference to the surroundings of
their homes, of the nomadic races. The Somali’s houses were
irregularly strewn on the bare ground, and looked as if
they had been nailed together with a bushel of four-inch
nails, to last for a week. It was a surprising thing, when you
entered one of them, to find it inside so neat and fresh,
scented with Arab incenses, with fine carpets and hangings,
vessels of brass and silver, and swords with ivory hilts and
noble blades. The Somali women themselves had dignified,
gentle ways, and were hospitable and gay, with a laughter
like silver bells. I was much at home in the Somali village


12



KAMANTE AND LULU


through my Somali servant Farah Aden, who was with me
all the time that I was in Africa, and I went to many of
their feasts. A big Somali wedding is a magnificent, tradi-
tional festivity. As a guest of honour I was taken into the
bridal chamber, where the w^alls and the bridal bed were
hung with old gently glowing weavings and embroideries,
and the dark-eyed young bride herself was stiff, like a mar-
shal’s baton with heavy silks, gold and amber.

The Somali were cattle-dealers and traders all over the
country. For the transport of their goods they kept a num-
ber of little grey donkeys in the village, and I have seen
camels there as well: haughty, hardened products of the
desert, beyond all earthly sufferings, like Cactus, and like
the Somali.

The Somali bring much trouble upon themselves by their
terrible tribal quarrels. In this matter they feel and reason
differently from other people. Farah belonged to the tribe
of Habr Yunis, so that personally in a quarrel I sided with
them. At one time there was a great real fight in the Somali
town, between the two tribes of Dulba Hands and Habr
Chaolo, with rifle-shooting and fires, and ten or twelve peo-
ple Idlled, until the Government interfered. Farah then had
a young friend of his own tribe, by name of Sayid, who
used to come out to see him at the farm, and who was a
graceful boy, so that I was sorry when I was told by my
houseboys that Sayid had gone round to visit a Habr Chaolo
family in their house, when an angry member of the Dulba
Hands tribe had passed and fired two shots at haphazard
through the wall of the house and broken Sayid’s leg. I
condoled with Farah on his friend’s misfortune.— “What?
Sayid?” Farah cried out with vehemence. “That was good
enough for Sayid. Why must he go and drink tea in the
house of a Habr Chaolo?”


13



OUT OF AFRICA

The Indians of Nairobi dominated the big Native busi-
ness quarter of the Bazaar, and the great Indian merchants
had their little Villas just outside the town: Jevanjee, Sulei-
man Virjee, Allidina Visram. They all had a taste for stone-
work-stairs, balusters, and vases, rather badly cut out of the
soft stone of the country,— like the structures which chil-
dren build of pink ornamental bricks. They gave tea-parties
in their gardens, with Indian pastry in the style of the Villas,
and were clever, travelled, highly polite people. But the
Indians in Africa are such grasping tradesmen that with
them you would never know if you were face to face with a
human individual or with the head of a firm. I had been to
Suleiman Virjee’s house, and when one day I saw the flag
at half mast above his big compound of warehouse, I asked
Farah: ‘*Is Suleiman Virjee dead?” “Half dead,” said Farah.
“Do they put the flag at half mast when he is half dead.>” I
asked. “Suleiman is dead,” said Farah. “Virjee is alive.”

Before I took over the management of the farm, I had
been keen on shooting and bad been out on many Safaris.
But when I became a farmer I put away my rifles.

The Masai, the nomadic, cattle-owning nation, were
neighbours of the farm and lived on the other side of the
river; from time to time some of them would come to my
house to complain about a lion that was taking their cows,
and to ask me to go out and shoot it for them, and I did so
if I could. Sometimes, on Saturday, I also walked out on the
Orungi plains to shoot a Zebra or two as meat for my farm-
labourers, with a long tail of optimistic young Kikuyu after
me. I shot birds on the farm, spurfowl and guineafowl, that
are very good to eat. But for many years I was not out on;
any shooting expedition.

Still, we often talked on the farm of the Safaris that we-

14



KAMANTE AND LULU


had been on. Camping-places fix themselves in your mind
as if you had spent long periods of your life in them. You
will remember a curve of your waggon track in the grass of
the plain, like the features of a friend.

Out on the Safaris, I had seen a herd of Buffalo, one hun-
dred and twenty-nine of them, come out of the morning
mist under a copper sky, one by one, as if the dark and
massive, iron-like animals with the mighty horizontally
swung horns were not approaching, but were being created
before my eyes and sent out as they were finished. I had
seen a herd of Elephant travelling through dense Native
forest, where the sunlight is strewn down between the thick
creepers in small spots and patches, pacing along as if they
had an appointment at the end of the world. It was, in
giant size, the border of a very old, infinitely precious Per-
sian carpet, in the dyes of green, yellow and black-brown.
I had time after time watched the progression across the
plain of the Giraffe, in their queer, inimitable, vegetative
gracefulness, as if it were not a herd of animals but a family
of rare, long-stemmed, speckled gigantic flowers slowly
advancing. I had followed two Rhinos on their morning
promenade, when they were sniffing and snorting in the air
of the dawn,— which is so cold that it hurts in the nose,—
and looked like two very big angular stones rollicking in
the long valley and enjoying life together. I had seen the
royal lion, before sunrise, below a waning moon, crossing
the grey plain on his way home from the kiU, drawing a
dark wake in the silvery grass, his face still red up to the
ears, or during the midday-siesta, when he reposed con-
tentedly in the midst of his family on the short grass and in
the delicate, spring-like shade of the broad Acacia trees of
his park of Africa.

All these things were pleasant to think of when times

15



OUT OF AFRICA


were dull on the farm. And the big game was out there si
in their own country; I could go and look them up oi
more if I liked. Their nearness gave a shine and play to
atmosphere of the farm. Farah,— although with time he ca
to take a vivid interest in farm-affairs,— and my old nat
Safari-servants, lived in hope of other Safaris.

Out in the wilds I had learned to beware of abrupt mo
ments. The creatures with which you are dealing there
shy and watchful, they have a talent for evading you wl
you least expect it. No domestic animal can be as still j
wild animal. The civilized people have lost the aptitude
stillness, and must take lessons in silence from the wild
fore they are accepted by it. The art of moving gen
without suddenness, is the first to be studied by the hun
and more so by the hunter with the camera. Hunters can
have their, own way, they must fall in with the wind,
the colours and smells of the landscape, and they must m
the tempo of the ensemble their own. Sometimes it rep
a movement over and over again, and they must follow
with it.

When you have caught the rhythm of Africa, you .
that it is the same in all her music. What I learned from
game of the country, was useful to me in my dealings ^
the Native People.

The love of woman and womanliness is a masculine c!
acteristic, and the love of man and manliness a femi:
characteristic, and there is a susceptibility to the Soutl
countries and races that is a Nordic quality. The Nom
must have fallen in love with the foreign countries,
with France and then with England. Those old Mil
who figure in the history and fiction of the eighteenth (
tury, as constantly travelling in Italy, Greece and Spain,

not a single Southern trait in their nature, but were drawn
and held by the fascination of things wholly different from
themselves. The old German and Scandinavian painters,
philosophers and poets, when they first came to Florence
and Rome, went down on their knees to adore the South.

A queer illogical patience towards an alien world came
out in these impatient people. As it is almost impossible for
a woman to irritate a real man, and as to the women, a man
is never quite contemptible, never altogether rejectable, as
long as he remains a man, so were the hasty red-haired
Northern people infinitely long-suffering with the tropical
countries and races. They would stand no nonsense from
their own country or their own relations, but they took the
drought of the African Highlands, and a case of sun-stroke,
the Rinderpest on their cattle, and the incompetency of
their Native servants, with humility and resignation. Their
sense of individuality itself was lost in the sense of the pos-
sibilities that lie in interaction between those who can be
made one by reason of their incongruity. The people of
Southern Europe and the people of mixed blood have not
got this quality; they blame it, or scorn it. So the men’s
men scorn the sighing lover, and the rational women who
have no patience with their men, are in the same way in-
dignant with Griselda.

As for me, from my first weeks in Africa, I had felt a
great affection for the Natives. It was a strong feeling that
embraced all ages and both sexes. The discovery of the dark
races was to me a magnificent enlargement of all my world.
If a person with an inborn sympathy for animals had grown
up in a milieu where there were no animals, and had come
into contact with animals late in life; or if a person with an
instinctive taste for woods and forest had entered a forest
for the first time at the age of twenty; or if some one with

17



OUT OF AFRICA


an ear for music had happened to hear music for the first
time when he was already grown up; their cases might have
been similar to mine. After I had met with the Natives, I
set out the routine of my daily life to the Orchestra.

My father was an officer in the Danish and French army,
and as a very young lieutenant at Diippel he wrote home:
“Back in Diippel I was officer to a long column. It was hard
work, but it was splendid. The love of war is a passion like
another, you love soldiers as you love young womenfolk,—
to madness, and the one love does not exclude the other, as
the girls know. But the love of women can include only
one at a time, and the love for your soldiers comprehends
the whole regiment, which you would like enlarged if it
were possible.” It was the same thing with the Natives and
me.

It was not easy to get to know the Natives. They were
quick of hearing, and evanescent; if you frightened them
they could withdraw into a world of their own, in a second,
like the wild animals which at an abrupt movement from
you are gone,— simply are not there. Until you knew a Na-
tive well, it was almost impossible to get a straight answer
from him. To a direct question as to how many cows he
had, he had an eluding reply,— “As many as I told you yes-
terday.” It goes against the feelings of Europeans to be
answered in such a manner, it very likely goes against the
feelings of the Natives to be questioned in this way. If we
pressed or pursued them, to get an explanation of their be-
haviour out of them, they receded as long as they possibly
could, and then they used a grotesque humorous fantasy to
lead us on the wrong track. Even small children in this situ-
ation had all the quality of old Poker-players, who do not
mind if you overvalue or undervalue their hand, so long as
you do not know its real nature. When we really did break
i8



KAMANTE AND LULU


into the Natives’ existence, they behaved like ants, when
you poke a stick into their ant-hill; they wiped out the
damage with unwearied energy, swiftly arid silently,— as if
obliterating an unseemly action.

We could not know, and could not imagine, what the
dangers were that they feared from our hands. I myself
think that they were afraid of us more in the manner in
which you are afraid of a sudden terrific noise, than as you
are afraid of suffering and death. And yet it was difficult to
tell, for the Natives were great at the art of mimicry. In
the shambas you would sometimes in the early morning
come upon a spurfowl which would run in front of your
horse as if her wing was broken, and she was terrified of
being caught by the dogs. But her wing was not broken,
and she was not afraid of the dogs,— she could whir up be-
fore them the moment she chose,— only she had got her
brood of young chickens somewhere near by, and she was
drawing our attention away from them. Like the spurfowl,
the Natives might be mimicking a fear of us because of some
other deeper dread the nature of which we could not guess.
Or in the end their behaviour to us might be some sort of
strange joke, and the shy people were not afraid of us at
all. The Natives have, far less than the white people, the
sense of risks in life. Sometimes on a Safari, or on the farm,
in a moment of extreme tension, I have met the eyes of my
Native companions, and have felt that we were at a great
distance from one another, and that they were wondering
at my apprehension of our risk. It made me reflect that per-
haps they were, in life itself, within their own element, such
as we can never be, like fishes in deep water which for the
life of them cannot understand our fear of drowning. This
assurance, this art of swimming, they had, I thought, be-
cause they had preserved a knowledge that was lost to us

19



OUT OF AFRICA

by our first parents; Africa, amongst the continents, will
teach it to you: that God and the Devil are one, the maj-
esty coeternal, not two uncreated but one uncreated, and
the Natives neither confounded the persons nor divided
the substance.

On our Safaris, and on the farm, my acquaintance with
the Natives developed into a settled and personal relation-
ship. We were good friends. I reconciled myself to the fact
that while I should never quite know or understand them,
they knew me through and through, and were conscious of
the decisions that I was going to take, before I was certain
about them myself. For some time I had a small farm up at
Gil-Gil, where I lived in a tent, and I travelled by the rail-
way to and fro between Gil-Gil and Ngong. At Gil-Gil, I
might make up my mind very suddenly, when it began to
rain, to go back to my house. But when I came to Kikuyu,
which was our station on the railway line, and from where
it was ten miles to the farm, one of my people would be
there with a mule for me to ride home on. When I asked
them how they had known that I was coming down, they
looked away, and seemed uneasy, as if frightened or bored,
such as we should be if a deaf person insisted on getting an
explanation of a symphony from us.

When the Natives felt safe with us from abrupt move-
ments and sudden noises, they would speak to us a great
deal more openly than one European speaks to another.
They were never reliable, but in a grand manner sincere. A
good name,— what is called prestige,— meant much in the
Native world. They seemed to have made up, at some time,
a joint appraisal of you, against which no one would
afterwards ever go.

At times, life on the farm was very lonely, and in the
stillness of the evenings when the minutes dripped from the
20



KAMANTE AND LULU


clock, life seemed to be dripping out of you with them,
just for want of white people to talk to. But all the time I
felt the silent overshadowed existence of the Natives run-
ning parallel with my own, on a different plane. Echoes
went from the one to the other.

The Natives were Africa in flesh and blood. The tall ex-
tinct volcano of Longonot that rises above the Rift Valley,
the broad Mimosa trees along the rivers, the Elephant and
the Giraffe, were not more truly Africa than the Natives
were, —small figures in an immense scenery. All were differ-
ent expressions of one idea, variations upon the same theme.
It was not a congenial upheaping of heterogeneous atoms,
but a heterogeneous upheaping of congenial atoms, as in the
case of the oak-leaf and the acorn and the object made
from oak. We ourselves, in boots, and in our constant great
hurry, often jar with the landscape. The Natives are in ac-
cordance with it, and when the tall, slim, dark, and dark-
eyed people travel,— always one by one, so that even the
great Native veins of traffic are narrow foot-paths,— or work
the soil, or herd their cattle, or hold their big dances, or
tell you a tale, it is Africa wandering, dancing and enter-
taining you. In the highlands you remember the Poet's
words:

Noble found I

ever the Native,

and insipid the Immigrant.

The Colony is changing and has already changed since I
lived there. When I write down as accurately as possible
my experiences on the farm, with the country and with
some of the inhabitants of the plains and woods, it may
have a sort of historical interest.

Kamante was a small Kikuyu boy, the son of one of my
squatters. I used to know my squatter children well, for
they both worked for me on the farm, and used to be
up round my house herding their goats on the lawns, in the
faith that here something of interest might always occur.
But Kamante must have lived on the farm for some years
before I ever met him; I suppose that he had been leading
a seclusive existence, like a sick animal.

I came upon him for the first time one day when I was
riding across the plain of the farm, and he was herding his
people’s goats there. He was the most pitiful object that
you could set eyes on. His head was big and his body ter-
ribly small and thin, the elbows and knees stood out like
knots on a stick and both his legs were covered with deep
running sores from the thigh to the heel. Here on the plain
he looked extraordinarily small, so that it struck you as a
strange thing that so much suffering could be condensed
into a single point. When I stopped and spoke to him, he did
not answer, and hardly appeared to see me. In his flat, an-
gular, harassed, and infinitely patient face, the eyes were
without glance, dim like the eyes of a dead person. He
looked as if he could not have more than a few weeks to



KAMANTE AND LULU


live, and you expected to see the vultures, which are
never far away from death on the plain, high up in the pale
burning air over his head. I told him to come round to my
house the next morning, so that I could try to cure him.

I was a doctor to the people on the farm most mornings
from nine to ten, and like all great quacks I had a large circle
of patients, and generally between two and a dozen sick
people up by my house then.

The Kikuyu are adjusted for the unforeseen and accus-
tomed to the unexpected. Here they differ from the white
men, of whom the majority strive to insure themselves
against the unknown and the assaults of fate. The Negro is
on friendly terms with destiny, having been in her hands
all his time; she is to him, in a way, his home, the familiar
darkness of the hut, deep mould for his roots. He faces
any change in life with great calm. Amongst the qualities
that he will be looking for in a master or a doctor or in
God, imagination, I believe, comes high up in the list. It
may be on the strength of such a taste, that the Caliph
Haroun al Raschid maintains, to the hearts of Africa and
Arabia, his position as an ideal ruler; with him nobody knew
what to expect next, and you did not know where you had
him. When the Africans speak of the personality of God
they speak like the Arabian Nights or like the last chapters
of the book of Job; it is the same quality, the infinite power
of imagination, with which they are impressed.

To this characteristic in my people I myself owed my
popularity, or my fame, as a doctor. When I first came out
to Africa I travelled on the boat with a great German Sci-
entist, who was going out, for the twenty-third time, to
experiment with cures for sleeping-sickness, and who had
over a hundred rats and guinea-pigs on the boat with him.
He told me that his difficulty with the Native patients had

23



OUT OF AFRICA

never been any lack of courage in them,— in the face of pain
or of a great operation they generally showed little fear,—
but it was their deep dislike of regularity, of any repeated
treatment or the systematization of the whole; and this the
great German doctor could not understand. But when I
myself got to know the Natives, this quality in them was
one of the things that I liked best. They had real courage:
the unadulterated liking of danger,— the true answer of cre-
ation to the announcement of their lot,— the echo from the
earth when heaven had spoken. I sometimes thought that
what, at the bottom of their hearts, they feared from us was
pedantry. In the hands of a pedant they die of grief.

My patients waited on a paved terrace outside my house.
Here they squatted,— the old skeletons of men with tearing
coughs and running eyes, the young slim smooth brawlers
with black eyes and bruised mouths, and the mothers with
their feverish children, like little dry flowers, hanging upon
their necks. I often had bad burns to treat, for the Kikuyu
at night sleep round the fires in their huts, and the piles of
burning wood or charcoal may collapse and slide down on
them,— when at times I had run out of my store of medicine,
I found that honey was not a bad ointment for burns. The
atmosphere of the terrace was animated, electric, like the
atmosphere of the Casinos in Europe. The low lively flow
of talk would stop when I came out, but the silence was
pregnant with possibilities, now the moment had come when
anything might happen. They did however always wait for
me myself to choose my first patient.

I knew very little of doctoring, just what you learn at a
first aid course. But my renown as a doctor had been spread
by a few chance lucky cures, and had not been decreased
by the catastrophic mistakes that I had made.

If now I had been able to guarantee my patients a recov-
24



KAMANTE AND LULU


ery in each single case, who knows but that their circle
might have thinned out? I should then have attained a pro-
fessional prestige, —here evidently was a highly efficient doc-
tor from V olaia—hMt would they still have been sure that
the Lord was with me? For of the Lord they knew from
the great years of drought, from the lions on the plains at
night, and the leopards near the houses when the children
were alone there, and from the swarms of grasshoppers
that would come on to the land, nobody knew where-from,
and leave not a leaf of grass where they had passed. They
knew Him, too, from the unbelievable hours -of happiness
when the swarm passed over the maizefield and did not
settle, or when in Spring the rains would come early and
plentiful, and make all the fields and plains flower and give
rich crops. So that this highly capable doctor from Volaia
might be after all a sort of outsider where the real great
things in life were concerned.

Kamante to my surprise turned up at my house the morn-
ing after our first meeting. He stood there, a little away
from the three or four other sick people present, erect, with
his half-dead face, as if after all he had some feeling of at-
tachment to life, and had now made up his mind to try this
last chance of holding on to it.

He showed himself with time to be an excellent patient.
He came when he was ordered to come, without fault, and
he could keep account of time when he was told to come
back every third or fourth day, which is an unusual thing
with the Natives. He bore the hard treatment of his sores
with a stoicism that I have not known the like of. In all
these respects I might have held him up as a model to the
others, but I did not do so, for at the same time he caused
me much uneasiness of mind.


25



OUT OF AFRICA

Rarely, rarely, have I met such a wild creature, a human
being who was so utterly isolated from the world, and, by
a sort of firm deadly resignation, completely closed to all
surrounding life. I could make him answer when I ques-
tioned him, but he never volunteered a word and never
looked at me. He had no pity whatever in him, and kept
a little scornful laughter of contempt, and of knowing
better, for the tears of the other sick children, when they
were washed and bandaged, but he never looked at them
either. He had no wish for any sort of contact with the
world round him, the contacts that he had known of had
been too cruel for that. His fortitude of soul in the face of
pain was the fortitude of an old warrior. A thing could
never be so bad as to surprise him, he was, by his career
and his philosophy, prepared for the worst.

All this was in the grand manner, and recalled the declara-
tion of faith of Prometheus: “Pain is my element as hate is
thine. Ye rend me now: I care not.” And, “Ay, do thy
worst. Thou art omnipotent.” But in a person of his size it
was uncomfortable, a thing to make you lose heart. And
what will God think,— I thought,— confronted with this at-
titude in a small human being?

I remember well the first time that he ever looked at me
and spoke to me of his own accord. This must have been
some time along in our acquaintance, for I had given up my
first mode of treatment, and was trying a new thing, a hot
poultice that I had looked up in my books. In my eagerness
to do the thing thoroughly, I made it too hot, and as I put
it on his leg and clapped the dressing on the top of it
Kamante spoke;— “Msabu,” he said, and gave me a great
glance. The Natives use this Indian word when they address
white women, but they pronounce it a little differently, and
change it into an African word, with a diverging ring to it.

26



KAMANTE AND LULU


In Kamante’s mouth now it was a cry for help, but also a
word of warning, such as a loyal friend might give you,
to stop you in a proceeding unworthy of you. I thought of
it with hope afterwards. I had ambition as a doctor, and I
was sorry to have put on the poultice too hot, but I was
glad all the same, for this was the first glimpse of an under-
standing between the wild child and myself. The stark suf-
ferer, who expected nothing but suffering, did not expect it
from me.

As far as my doctoring of him went, things did not, how-
ever, look hopeful. For a long time I kept on washing and
bandaging his leg, but the disease was beyond me. From
time to time he would grow a little better, and then the
sores would break out in new places. In the end I made up
my mind to take him to the hospital of the Scotch Mission.

This decision of mine for once was sufficiently fatal, and
had in it enough possibilities, to make an impression on
Kamante,— he did not want to go. He was prevented by his
career and his philosophy from protesting much against
anything, but when I drove him to the Mission, and de-
livered him there in the long hospital building, in surround-
ings entirely foreign and mysterious to him, he trembled.

I had the Church of Scotland Mission as a neighbour
twelve miles to the North West, five hundred feet higher
than the farm; and the French Roman Catholic Mission ten
miles to the East, on the flatter land, and five hundred feet
lower. I did not sympathize with the Missions, but per-
sonally I was on friendly terms with them both, and re-
gretted that between themselves they should live in a state
of hostility.

The French Fathers were my best friends. I used to ride
over with Farah, to hear Mass with them on Sunday morn-
ing, partly in order to speak French again, and partly be-

27



OUT OF AFRICA


cause it was a lovely ride to the Mission. For a long way
the road ran through the Forest Department’s old wattle
plantation, and the virile fresh pinaceous scent of the wattle-
trees was sweet and cheering in the mornings.

It was an extraordinary thing to see how the Church of
Rome was carrying her atmosphere with her wherever she
went. The Fathers had planned and built their Church
themselves, with the assistance of their Native congre-
gation, and they were with reason very proud of it. There
was here a fine big grey Church with a bell-tower on
it; it was laid out on a broad courtyard, above terraces and
stairs, in the midst of their coffee-plantation, which was the
oldest in the Colony and very skilfully run. On the two
other sides of the court were the arcaded Refectory and
the Convent buildings, with the school and the mill down
by the river, and to get into the drive up to the Church you
had to ride over an arched bridge. It was all built in grey
stone, and as you came riding down upon it, it looked neat
and impressive in the landscape, and might have been lying
in a Southern canton of Switzerland, or in the North of
Italy.

The friendly Fathers lay in wait for me at the Church
door, when Mass was over, to invite me to un petit verre
de vin, across the courtyard in the roomy and cool Re-
fectory; there it was wonderful to hear how they knew of
everything that was going on in the Colony, even to the
remotest comers of it. They would also, under the disguise
of a sweet and benevolent conversation, draw from you any
sort of news that you might possibly have in you, like a
small lively group of brown, furry bees,— for they all grew
long, thick beards,— hanging on to a flower for its store of
honey. But while they were so interested in the life of the
Colony, they were all the time in their own French way
28



KAMANTE AND LULU


exiles, patient and cheerful obeisants to some higher orders
of a mysterious nature. If it had not been for the unknown
authority that kept them in the place, you felt they would
not be there, neither would the Church of grey stone with
the tall bell-tower, nor the arcades, the school or any other
part of their neat plantation and Mission station. For when
the word of relief had been given, all of these would leave
the affairs of the Colony to themselves and take a bee-line
back to Paris.

Farah, who had been holding the two ponies while I had
been to Church, and to the Refectory, on the way back to
the farm would notice my cheerful spirits,— he was himself
a pious Mohammedan and did not touch alcohol, but he
took the Mass and the wine as coordinant rites of my re-
ligion.

The French Fathers sometimes rode on their motor-
bicycles to the farm and lunched there, they quoted the
fables of Lafontaine to me, and gave me good advice on my
coffee-plantation.

The Scotch Mission I did not know so well. There was a
splendid view, from up there, over all the surrounding
Kikuyu country, but all the same the Mission station gave
me an impression of blindness, as if it could see nothing it-
self. The Church of Scotland was working hard to put the
Natives into European clothes, which, I thought, did them
no good from any point of view. But they had a very good
hospital at the Mission, and at the time when I was there, it
was in charge of a philanthropic, clever head-doctor, Dr.
Arthur. They saved the life of many of the people from
the farm.

At the Scotch Mission they kept Kamante for three
months. During that time I saw him once. I came riding
past the Mission on my way to the Kikuyu railway station,

29



OVT OF AFRICA

and the road here for a while runs along the hospital
grounds, I caught sight of Kamante in the grounds, he was
standing by himself at a little distance from the groups of
other convalescents. By this time he was already so much
better that he could run. When he saw me he came up to
the fence and ran with me as long as it was following the
road. He trotted along, on his side of the fence, like a foal
in a paddock when you pass it on horseback, and kept his
eyes on my pony, but he did not say a word. At the corner
of the hospital grounds he had to stop, and when as I rode
on, I looked back, I saw him standing stock still, with his
head up in the air, and staring after me, in the exact manner
of a foal when you ride away from it. I waved my hand to
him a couple of times, the first time he did not react at all,
then suddenly his arm went straight up like a pump-spear,
but he did not do it more than once.

Kamante came back to my house on the morning of
Easter Sunday, and handed me a letter from the hospital
people who declared that he was much better and that they
thought him cured for good. He must have known some-
thing of its contents for he watched my face attentively
while I was reading it, but he did not want to discuss it, he
had greater things in his mind. Kamante always carried him-
self with much collected or restrained dignity, but this
time he shone with repressed triumph as well.

All Natives have a strong sense for dramatic eflFects.
Kamante had carefully tied old bandages round his legs all
the way up to the knee, to arrange a surprise for me. It was
clear that he saw the vital importance of the moment, not
in his own good luck, but, unselfishly, in the pleasure that
he was to give me. He probably remembered the times
when he had seen me all upset by the continual failure of

3 ^>



KAMANTE AND LULU


my cures with him, and he knew that the result of the
hospital’s treatment was an astounding thing. As slowly,
slowly, he unwound the bandages from his knee to his heel
there appeared, underneath them, a pair of whole smooth
legs, only slightly marked by grey scars.

When Kamante had thoroughly, and in his calm grand
manner, enjoyed my astonishment and pleasure, he again
renewed the impression by stating that he was now a Chris-
tian. “I am like you,” he said. He added that he thought
that I might give him a Rupee because Christ had risen on
this same day,. ^

He went 'atvay' to call on his own people. His mother was
a widow, and lived a long way away on the farm. From
what I heard from her later I believe that he did upon this
day make a digression from his habit and unloaded his
heart to her of the impressions of strange people and ways
that he had received at the hospital. But after his visit to his
mother’s hut, he came back to my house as if he took it for
granted that now he belonged there. He was then in my
service from this time till the time that I left the country,—
for about twelve years.

Kamante when I first met him looked as if he were six
years old, but he had a brother who looked about eight, and
both brothers agreed that Kamante was the elder of them,
so I suppose he must have been set back in growth by his
long illness; he was probably then nine years old. He grew
up now, but he always made the impression of being a
dwarf, or in some way deformed, although you could not
put your finger on the precise spot that made him look so*
His angular face was rounded with time, he walked and
moved easily, and I myself did not think him bad-looking,
but I may have looked upon him with something of a crea-
tor’s eyes. His legs remained forever as thin as sticks. A fan-

tastic figure he always was, half of fun and half of diabolism;
with a very slight alteration, he might have sat and stared
down, on the top of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.
He had in him something bright and live; in a painting he
would have made a spot of unusually intense colouring; with
this he gave a stroke of picturesqueness to my household.
He was never quite right in the head, or at least he was al-
ways what, in a white person, you would have called highly
eccentric.

He was a thoughtful person. Perhaps the long years of
suffering that he had lived through, had developed in him a
tendency to reflect upon things, and to draw his own con-
clusions from everything he saw. He was all his life, in his
own way, an isolated figure. Even when he did the same
things as other people he would do them in a different way,

I had an Evening School for the people of the farm, with
a Native schoolmaster to teach them. I got my schoolmasters
from one of the Missions, and in my time I have had all
three,— Roman Catholic, Church of England, and Church of
Scotland schoolmasters. For the Native education of the
country is run rigorously on religious lines; so far as I know,
there are no other books translated into Swaheli than the
Bible and the hymn-books. I myself, during all my time in
Africa, was planning to translate iEsop’s fables, for the benefit
of the Natives, but I never found time to carry my plan
through. Still, such as it was, my school was to me a favourite
place on the farm, the centre of our spiritual life, and I spent
many pleasant evening hours in the long old store-house of
corrugated iron in which it was kept.

Kamante would then come with me, but he would not
join the children on the school-benches, he would stand a
little away from them, as if consciously closing his ears to
the learning, and exulting in the simplicity of those who con-
32



KAMANTE AND LULU

sented to be taken in, and to listen. But in the privacy of my
kitchen, I have seen him copying from memory, very slowly
and preposterously, those same letters and figures that he
had observed on the blackboard in the school. I do not think
tliat he could have come in with other people if he had
wanted to; early in his life something in him had been twisted
or locked, and now it was, so to say, to him the normal thing
to be out of the normal. He was aware of this separateness
of his, himself, with the arrogant greatness of soul of the real
dwarf, who, when he finds himself at a difference with the
whole world, holds the world to be crooked.

Kamante was shrewd in money matters, he spent little,
and did a number of wise deals with the other Kikuyu in
goats, he married at an early age, and marriage in the Ki-
kuyu world is an expensive undertaking. At the same time 1
have heard him philosophising, soundly and originally, upon
the worthlessness of money. He stood in a peculiar relation
to existence on the whole; he mastered it, but he had no high
opinion of it.

He had no gift whatever for admiration. He might ac-
knowledge, and think well of the wisdom of animals, but
there was, during all the time that I knew him, only one
human being of whose good sense I heard him speak approv-
ingly; it was a young Somali woman who some years later
came to live on the farm. He had a little mocking laughter,
of which he made use in all circumstances, but chiefly to-
wards any self-confidence or grandiloquence in other people.
All Natives have in them a strong strain of malice, a shrill
delight in things going wrong, which in itself is hurting and
revolting to Europeans. Kamante bi'ought this characteristic
to a rare perfection, even to a special self-irony, that made
him take pleasure in his own disappointments and disasters,
nearly exactly as in those of other people.

OUT OF AFRICA

1 have met with the same kind of mentality in the old Na-
tive women who have been roasted over many fires, who
have mixed blood with Fate, and recognize her irony, wher-
ever they meet it, with sympathy, as if it were that of a
sister. On the farm I used to let my houseboys deal out snuff,
--tombacco the Natives say,— to the old women on Sunday
mornings, wliile I myself was still in bed. On this account I
had a queer lot of customers round my house on Sundays,
like a very old, rumpled, bald and bony poultry yard; and
their low cackling,— for the Natives will very rarely speak
up loudly,— made its way through the open windows of my
bedroom. On one particular Sunday morning, the gentle
lively flow of Kikuyu communications suddenly rose to rip-
ples and cascades of mirth; some highly humorous incident
was taking place out there, and I called in Farah to tell me
about it. Farah did not like to tell me, for the matter was
that he had forgotten to buy snuff, so that to-day the old
women had come a long way, as they say themselves, boori^
—for nothing. This happening was later on a source of amuse-
ment to the old Kikuyu women. Sometimes, when I met one
of them on a path in the maizefield, she would stand still in
front of me, poke a crooked bony finger at me, and, with
her old dark face dissolving into laughter, so that all the
wrinkles of it were drawn and folded together as by one
single secret string being pulled, she would remind me of
the Sunday when she and her sisters in the snuff, had walked
and walked up to my house, only to find that I had forgot-
ten to get it, and that there was not a grain there,— Ha ha
Msabu!

The white people often say of the Kikuyu that they know
nothing of gratitude. Kamante in any case was not ungrate-
ful, he even gave words to his feeling of an obligation. A
number of times, many years after our first meeting, he

34



kamante and lulu


went out of his w^ay to do me a service for which I had not
asked him, and when I questioned him why he had done it^
he said that if it had not been for me he should have been
dead a long time ago. He showed his gratitude in another
manner as well, in a particular kind of benevolent, helpful,,
or perhaps the right word is, forbearing, attitude towards
me. It may be that he kept in mind that he and I were of
the same religion. In a world of fools, I was, I think, to him
one of the greater fools. From the day when he came into
my service and attached his fate to mine, I felt his watchful
penetrating eyes on me, and my whole modus viveiidi sub-
ject to clear unbiased criticism; I believe that from the be-
ginning, he looked upon the trouble that I had taken to get
him cured as upon a piece of hopeless eccentricity. But he
showed me all the time great interest and sympathy, and he
laid himself out to guide my great ignorance. On some occa-
sions I found that he had given time and thought to the
problem, and that he meant to prepare and illustrate his in-
structions, in order that they should be easier for me to
understand.

Kamante began his life in my house as a dog-toto, later he
became a medical assistant to me. There I found out what
good hands he had, although you would not have thought so
from the look of them, and I sent him into the kitchen to be
a cook’s boy, a marmiton, under my old cook Esa, who was
murdered. After Esa’s death he succeeded to him, and he
was now my Chef all the time that he was with me.

Natives have usually very little feeling for animals, but
Kamante dilfered from type here, as in other things, he was
an authoritative dog-boy, and he identified himself with the
dogs, and would come and communicate to me what the}r
wished, or missed, or generally thought of things. He kept

35



OUT OF AFRICA

the dogs free of fleas, which are a pest in Africa, and many
times in the middle of the night, he and I, called by the
howls of the dogs, have, by the light of a hurricane lamp,
picked off them, one by one, the murderous big ants, the
SictfUy which march alone and eat up everything on their
way.

He must also have used his eyes at the time when he had
been in the Mission hospital,— even if it had been as was
ever the case with him, without the slightest reverence or
prepossession,— for he was a thoughtful, inventive doctor’s
assistant. After he had left this ofHce, he would at times ap-^
pear from the kitchen to interfere in a case of sickness, and
give me very sound advice.

But as a Chef he was a different thing, and precluded clas-
sification. Nature had here taken a leap and cut away from
the order of precedence of faculties and talents, the thing
now became mystic and inexplicable, as ever where you are
dealing with genius. In the kitchen, in the culinary world,
Kamante had all the attributes of genius, even to that doom
of genius,— the individual’s powerlessness in the face of his
own powers. If Kamante had been born in Eiu'ope, and had
fallen into the hands of a clever teacher, he might have be-
come famous, and would have cut a droll figure in history.
And out here in Africa he made himself a name, his attitude
to his art was that of a master.

I was much interested in cookery myself, and on my first
visit back to Europe, I took lessons from a French Chef at a
celebrated restaurant, because I thought it would be an
:amusing thing to be able to make good food in Africa. The
Chef, Monsieur Perrochet, at that time made me an offer to
com© m with him in his business of the restaurant, for the
sake of my devotion to the art. Now when I found Kamante
at hand, as a familiar spirit to cook with, this devotion again

36



RAM ANTE AND LULU


took hold of me. There was to me a great perspective in our
working together. Nothing, I thought, could be more mys-
terious than this natural instinct in a Savage for our culiiiaiy
art. It made me take another view of our civilization; after
all it might be in some way divine and predestinated. I felt
like the man who regained his faith in God because a Phre-
nologist showed him the seat in the human brain of theo-
logical eloquence: if the existence of theological eloquence
could be proved, the existence of theology itself was proved
with it, and, in the end, God’s existence.

Kamante, in all cooking matters, had a surprising manual
adroitness. The great tricks and tours-de-force of the kitchen
were child’s play to his dark crooked hands; they knew on
their own everything about omelettes, vol-auwents, sauces,
and mayonnaises. He had a special gift for making things
light, as in the legend the infant Christ forms birds out of
clay and tells them to fly. He scorned all complicated tools,
as if impatient of too much independence in them, and when
I gave him a machine for beating eggs he set it aside to rust,
and beat whites of egg with a weeding knife that I had had
to weed the lawn with, and his whites of eggs towered up
like hght clouds. As a Cook he had a penetrating, inspired
eye, and would pick out the fattest chicken out of a whole
poultry yard, and he gravely weighed an egg in his hand,
and knew when it had been laid. He thought out schemes
for improvement of my table, and by some means of com-
munication, from a friend who was working for a doctor
far away in the country, he got me seed of a really excellent
sort of lettuce, such as I had myself for many years looked
for in vain.

He had a great memory for recipes. He could not read,
and he knew no English so that cookery-books were of no
use to him, but he must have held all that he was ever taught

37



OUT OF AFRICA

Stored up in his ungraceful head, according to some sys^
tematization of his own, which I should never know. He
had named the dishes after some event which had taken
place on the day they had been shown to him, and he spoke
of the sauce of the lightning that struck the tree, and of the
sauce of the grey horse that died. But he did not confound
any two of these things. There was only one point that I
tried to impress upon him without any success, that was the
order of the courses within a meal. It became necessary to
me, when I had guests for dinner, to draw up for my chef,
as if it were a pictorial menu; first a soup-plate, then a fish,
then a partridge, or an artichoke. I did not quite believe this
shortcoming in him to be due to a faulty memory, but he
did, I think, in his own heart, maintain that there is a limit
to everything, and that upon anything so completely im-
material, he would not waste his time.

It is a moving thing to work together with a demon. Nomi-
nally the kitchen was mine, but in the course of our cooper-
ations, I felt not only the kitchen, but the whole world in
which we were cooperating, pass over into Kamante’s hands.
For here he understood to perfection what I wished of him,
and sometimes he carried out my wishes even before I had
told him of them; but as to me I could not make clear to
myself how or indeed why he worked as he did. It seemed
to me a strange thing that anyone could be so great in an
art of which he did not understand the real meaning, and for
which he felt nothing but contempt.

Kamante could have no idea as to how a dish of ours
ought to taste, and he was, in spite of his conversion, and his
connection with civilization, at heart an arrant Kikuyu,
rooted in the traditions of his tribe and in his faith in them,
as in the only way of living worthy of a human being. He
did at times taste the food that he cooked, but then with a

38



KAMANTE AND LULU


distrustful face, like a witch who takes a sip out of her caul-
dron. He stuck to the maizecobs of his fathers. Here even
his intelligence sometimes failed him, and he came and offered
me a Kikuyu delicacy ,~a roasted sweet potato or a lump of
sheep’s fat,— as even a civilized dog, that has lived for a long
time with people, will place a bone on the floor before you,
as a present. In his heart he did, I feel, all the time, look
upon the trouble that we give ourselves about our food, as
upon a lunacy. I sometimes tried to extract from him his
views upon these things, but although he spoke with great
frankness on many subjects, on others he w^as very close, so
that we worked side by side in the kitchen, leaving one an-
other’s ideas on the importance of cooking, alone.

I sent Kamante in to the Muthaiga Club to learn, and to
the cooks of my friends in Nairobi, when I had had a new
good dish in their house, and by the time that he had served
his apprenticeship, my own house became famous in the
Colony for its table. This was a great pleasure to me. I
longed to have an audience for my art, and I was glad when
my friends came out to dine with me; but Kamante cared
for the praise of no one. All the same he remembered the
individual taste of those of my friends w’^ho came most often
to the farm. “I shall cook the fish in white wine for Bw^ana
Berkeley Cole,” he said, gravely, as if he were speaking of a
demented person. ‘‘He sends you out white wine himself to
cook fish in.” To get the opinion of an authority, I asked
my old friend Mr. Charles Bulpett of Nairobi, out to dine
with me. Mr. Bulpett was a great traveller of the former gen-
eration, themselves a generation away from Phineas Fogg;
he had been all over the world and had tasted everywhere
the best it had to offer, and he had not cared to secure his
future so long as he could enjoy the present moment. The
books about sport and mountaineering, of fifty years ago,

39



OUT OF AFRICA

tell of his exploits as an athlete, and of his mountain climb-
ings in Switzerland and Mexico, and there is a book of fa-
mous bets called Light Come Light Go, in which you can
read of how for a bet he swam the Thames in evening
clothes and a high hat— but later on, and more romantically,
he swam the Hellespont like Leander and Lord Byron. I
was happy when he came out to the farm for a tete-a-tete
dinner; Aere is a particular happiness in giving a man whom
you like very much, good food that you have cooked your-
self. In return he gave me his ideas on food, and on many
other things in the world, and told me that he had nowhere
dined better.

The Prince of Wales did me the great honour to come
and dine at the farm, and to compliment me on a Cumber-
land Sauce. This is the only time that I have seen Kamante
listening with deep interest when I repeated the praise of his
cooking to him, for Natives have very great ideas of kings
and like to talk about them. Many months after, he felt a
longing to hear it once more, and suddenly asked me, like a
Frendi reading-book, “Did the son of the Sultan like the
sauce of the pig? Did he eat it all?”

Kamante showed his good will towards me, outside of the
kitchen as well. He wanted to help me, in accordance with
his own ideas of the advantages and dangers in life.

One night, after midnight, he suddenly walked into my
bedroom with a hurricane-lamp in his hand, silent, as if on
duty. It must have been only a short time after he first came
into my house, for he was very small; he stood by my bed-
side like a dark bat that had strayed into the room, with
very big spreading ears, or like a small African Will-o’-the-
wisp, with his lamp in his hand. He spoke to me very sol-
emiily, “Msabu,” he said, “I think you had better get up.”
I sat up in bed bewildered; I thought that if anything serious
40



KAMANTE AND LULU

had happened, it would have been Farah who would have
come to fetch me, but when I told Kamante to go away again,
he did not move. “Msabu,’’ he said again, '1 think that you had
better get up. I think that God is coming.” When I heard
this, I did get up, and asked him why he thought so. He
gravely led me into the dining-room which looked West,
towards the hills. From the door- windows I now saw a
strange phenomenon. There was a big grass-fire going on,
out in the hills, and the grass was burning all the way from
the hill-top to the plain; wTen seen from the house it was a
nearly vertical line. It did indeed look as if some gigantic
figure was moving and coming towards us. I stood for some
time and looked at it, with Kamante watching by my side,
then I began to explain the thing to him. I meant to quiet
him, for I thought that he had been terribly frightened. But
the explanation did not seem to make much impression on
him one way or the other; he clearly took his mission to
have been fulfilled when he had called me. “Well yes,” he
said, “it may be so. But I thought that you had better get
up in case it was God coming.”

One year the long rains failed.

That is a terrible, tremendous experience, and the farmer
who has lived through it, will never forget it. Years after-
wards, away from Africa, in the wet climate of a Northern
country, he will start up at night, at the sound of a sudden
shower of rain, and cry, “At last, at last.”

In normal years the long rains began in the last week of
March and went on into the middle of June. Up to the time
of the rains, the world grew hotter and drier every day,
feverish, as in Europe before a great thunderstorm, only
more so.

The Masai, who were my neighbours on the other side of
the river, at that time set fire to the bast-dry plains to get
new green grass for their cattle with the first rain, and the air
over the plains danced with the mighty conflagration; the long
grey and rainbow-tinted layers of smoke rolled along over
the grass, and the heat and the smell of burning were drifted
in over the cultivated land as from a furnace.

Gigantic clouds gathered, and dissolved again, over the
landscape; a light distant shower of rain painted a blue slant-
ing streak across the horizon. All the world had only one
thought.

KAMANTE AND LULU

On an evening just before sunset, the scenery drew close
round you, the hills came near and were vigorous, meaning-
ful, in their clear, deep blue and green colouring. A couple
of hours later you went out and saw that the stars had gone,
and you felt the night-air soft and deep and pregnant with
benefaction.

When the quickly growing rushing sound wandered over
your head it was the wind in the tall forest-trees,— and not
the rain. When it ran along the ground it was the wind in
the shrubs and the long grass,— and not the rain. When it
rustled and rattled just above the ground it was the wind m
the maize-fields,— where it sounded so much like rain that
you were taken in, time after time, and even got a certain
content from it, as if you were at least shown the thing you
longed for acted on a stage,— and not the rain.

But when the earth answered like a sounding-board in a
deep fertile roar, and the world sang round you in all dimen-
sions, all above and below,— that was the rain. It was like
coming back to the Sea, when you have been a long time
away from it, like a lover’s embrace.

But one year the long rains failed. It was, then, as if the
Universe were turning away from you. It grew cooler, on
some days it would be cold, but there was no sign of moisture
in the atmosphere. Everything became drier and harder,
and it was as if all force and gracefulness had withdrawn
from the world. It was not bad weather or good weather,
but a negation of all weather, as if it had been deferred sine
die, A bleak wind, like a draught, ran over your head, all
colour faded from all things; the smells went away from the
fields and forests. The feeling of being in disgrace with the
Great Powers pressed on you. To the South, the burnt
plains lay black and waste, striped with grey and white ashes.

With every day, in which we now waited for the rain in

43



OUT OF AFRICA

vain, prospects and hopes of the farm grew dim, and dis-
appeared. The ploughing, pruning and planting of the last
months turned out to be a labour of fools. The farm work
slowed off, and stood still.

On the plains and in the hills, the waterholes dried up, and
many new kinds of ducks and geese came to my pond. To
the pond on the boundary of the farm, the Zebra came wan-
dering in the early mornings and at sunset to drink, in long
rows, two or three hundred of them, the foals walking with
the mares, and they were not afraid of me when I rode out
amongst them. But we tried to keep them off the land for
the sake of our cattle, for the water was sinking in the ponds.
Still it was a pleasure to go down there, where the rushes
growing in the mud made a green patch in the brown land-
scape.

The Natives became silent under the drought, I could not
get a word on the prospects out of them, although you
would have thought that they should have known more
about the signs of the weather than we did. It was their ex-
istence which was at stake, it was not an unheard of thing to
them,— and had not been to their fathers,— to lose nine-tenths
of their stock in the great years of drought. Their shambas
were dry, with a few drooping and withering sweet-potato
and maize plants.

After a time I learned their manner from them, and gave
up talking of the hard times or complaining about them, like
a person in disgrace. But I was a European, and I had not
lived long enough in the country to acquire the absolute
passivity of the Native, as some Europeans will do, who live
for many decennaries in Africa. I was young, and by in-
stinct of self-preservation, I had to collect my energy on
something, if I were not to be whirled away with the dust
on the farm-roads, or the smoke on the plain. I began in the

44



KAMANTE AND LULU


evenings to write stories, fairy-tales and romances, that would
take my mind a long way off, to other countries and times.

I had been telling some of the stories to a friend when he
came to stay on the farm.

When I got up and went outside, there was a cruel wind
blowing, the sky was clear and set with millions of hard
stars, everything w’as dry.

At first I wrote in the evenings only, but later on I often
sat down to write in the mornings as well, when I ought to
have been out on the farm. It was difBcult, out there, to
decide whether we ought to plough the maize-field up again
and plant it a second time, and whether we ought to strip
the withering coffee berries off the trees to save the trees, oi
not. I put the decisions off from day to day.

I used to sit and write in the dining-room, with papers
spread all over the dinner table, for I had accounts and esti-
mates of the farm to do, in berween my stories, and little
desolate notes from my farm manager to answer. My house-
boys asked me what I was doing; when I told them I was
trying to write a book, they looked upon it as a last attempt
to save the farm through the hard times, and took an interest
in it. Later they asked me how my book was proceeding.
They w^ould come in, and stand for a long time watching
the progress of it, and in the panelled room their heads were
so much the colour of the panels, that at night it looked as
if they were white robes only, keeping me company with
their backs to the Avail,

My dining-room looked West, and had three long win-
dows that opened out to the paved terrace, the lawn and the
forest. The land here sloped down to the river that formed
the boundary between me and the Masai. You could not see
the river itself from the house, but you could follow its

45



OUT OF AFRICA

winding course by the design of the dark-green big Acacias
which grew along it. To the other side of it the wood-clad
land rose again, and over the woods were the green plains
that reached to the foot of the Ngong Hills.

‘And were my faith so strong that it could move moun-
tains, that is the mountain that I would make come to me.”

The wind blew from the East: the doors of my dining-
room, to lee, were always open, and for this reason the West
side of the house was popular with the Natives; they laid
their way round it, to keep in touch with what was going
ison inside. From the same motive the little Native herdboys
brought their goats round and made them graze on the lawn.

These little boys, who wandered about on the farm in the
company of their fathers’ herds of goats and sheep, looking
up grazing for them, did in a way form a link between the
•life of my civilized house and the life of the wild. My house-
-boys distrusted them and did not like them to come into
the rooms, but the children had a real love and enthusiasm
for civilization; to them it held no dangers at all, for they
ccould leave it again whenever they liked. The central sym-
bol of it to them, was an old German cuckoo-clock that
hung in the dining-room. A clock was entirely an object of
luxury in the African Highlands. All the year round you
could tell, from the position of the sun, what the time was,
and as you had no dealings with railways, and could arrange
your life on the farm according to your own wishes, it be-
came a matter of no importance. But this was a very fine
clock. In the midst of a cluster of pink roses, at every full
hour, a cuckoo here flung up its little door and threw itself
forward to announce the hour in a clear insolent voice. Its
apparition was every time a fresh delight to the young peo-
ple of the farm. From the position of the sun, they judged
accurately when the moment for the midday call was due,
46



KAMANTE AND LULU


and by a quarter to twelve I could see them approaching the.
house from all sides, at the tail of their goats, which they
dared not leave behind. The heads of the children and of
the goats swam through the bush and long grass of the for-
est like heads of frogs in a pond.

They left their flocks on the lawn and came in noiselessly
on their bare feet; the bigger ones were about ten years and
the youngest two years. They behaved very well, and kept
up a sort of self-made ceremonial for their visits, which
came to this: that they could move about freely in the house
so long as they did not touch anything, nor sit down, nor
speak unless spoken to. As the cuckoo rushed out on them,
a great movement of ecstasy and suppressed laughter ran
through the group. It also sometimes happened that a very
small herdboy, who did not feel any responsibility about the
goats, would come back in the early morning all by himself,
stand for a long time in front of the clock, now shut up and
silent, and address it in Kikuyu in a slow sing-song declara-
tion of love, then gravely walk out again. My houseboys
laughed at the herdboys, and confided to me that the chil-
dren were so ignorant that they believed the cuckoo to be
alive.

Now my houseboys came in themselves to watch the
work of the typewriter. Kamante sometimes stood by the
wall for an hour in the evening, his eyes ran to and fro like
dark drops under the eyelashes, as if he meant to learn enough
about the machine to take it to pieces and put it together
again.

One night as I looked up I met these profound attentive
eyes and after a moment he spoke. “Msabu,” he said, “do
you believe yourself that you can write a book?’'

I answered that I did not know.

To figure to oneself a conversation with Kamante one

47



OUT OF AFRICA

must imagine a long, pregnant, as if deeply responsible,
pause before each phrase. All Natives are masters in the art
of the pause and thereby give perspective to a discussion.

Kamante now made such a long pause, and then said, “I do
not believe it.”

I had nobody else to discuss my book with; I laid down
my paper and asked him why not. I now found that he had
been thinking the conversation over before, and prepared
himself for it; he stood with the Odyssey itself behind his
back, and here he laid it on the table.

^Xook, Msabu,” he said, “this is a good book. It hangs to-
gether from the one end to the other. Even if you hold it
up and shake it strongly, it does not come to pieces. The
man who has written it is very clever. But what you write,”
he went on, both with scorn and with a sort of friendly
compassion, “is some here and some there. When the people
forget to close the door it blows about, even down on the
floor and you are angry. It will not be a good book.”

I explained to him that in Europe the people would be
able to fix it all up together.

“Will your book then be as heavy as this?” Kamante asked,
weighing the Odyssey.

V^en he saw that I hesitated he handed it to me in order
that I might judge for myself.

“No,” I said, “it will not, but there are other books in the
library, as you know, that are lighter.”

“And as hard?” he asked.

I said it was expensive to make a book so hard.

He stood for some time in silence and then expressed his
greater hopes of my book, and perhaps also repentance of
his doubts, by picking up the scattered pages from the floor
and laying them on the table. Still he did not go away, but
48



KAMANTE AND LULU


Stood by the table and waited, and then asked me gravely:
“Msabu, what is there in books?”

As an illustration, I told him the story from the Odyssey
*of the hero and Polyphemus, and of how Odysseus had called
himself Noman, had put out Polyphemus’ eye, and had es-
caped tied up under the belly of a ram.

Kamante listened with interest and expressed as his opin-
ion, that the ram must have been of the same race as the
sheep of Mr. Long, of Elmentaita, which he had seen at the
cattle-show in Nairobi. He came back to Polyphemus, and
asked me if he had been black, like the Kikuyu. When I
said no, he wanted to know if Odysseus had been of my
own tribe or family.

“How did he,” he asked, “say the word, Noman, in his
own language? Say it.”

“He said Outis,^^ I told him. “He called himself Outis,
which in his language means Noman.”

“Must you write about the same thing?” he asked me.

“No,” I said, “people can write of anything they like. I
might write of you.”

Kamante who had opened up in the course of the talk^
here suddenly closed again, he looked down himself and
asked me in a low voice, what part of him I would write
about.

“I might write about the time when you were ill and were
out with the sheep on the plain,” I said, “what did you think
of then?”

His eyes wandered over the room, up and down; in the
end he said vaguely: I know not.

“Were you afraid?” I asked him.

After a pause, “Yes,” he said firmly, “all the boys on the
plain are afraid sometimes.”

“Of what were you afraid?” I said.


49



OUT OF AFRICA

Kamante stood silent for a little while, his face became
collected and deep, his eyes gazed inward. Then he looked
at me with a little wry grimace:

“Of Outis,” he said. “The boys on the plain are afraid of
Outis.”

A few days later, I heard Kamante explain to the other
houseboys that in Europe the book which I was writing
could be made to stick together, and that with terrible ex-
pense it could even be made as hard as the Odyssey, which
was again displayed. He himself, however, did not believe
that it could be made blue.

Kamante had a talent of his own that became of use to
him in my house. He could, I believe, cry when he wanted to.

If ever I scolded him in earnest, he stood up straight be-
fore me and looked me in the face, with that watchful, deep
sadness which the faces of the Natives take on in a single
moment; then his eyes welled, and filled with heavy tears
that slowly, one by one, rolled out and down over his cheeks.
I knew them to be pure crocodile’s tears, and in other peo-
ple they would not have affected me. But with Kamante it
was a different thing. His flat wooden face, on these occa-
sions, sank back into the world of darkness and infinite
loneliness, in which he had dwelt for many years. Such
heavy, dumb tears he might have wept as a little boy on the
plain, with the sheep round him. They made me uneasy,
and gave to the sins for which I scolded him a different as-
pect, a smaller look so that I did not want to go on talking
about them. In a way it was a demoralizing thing. Still I be-
lieve that by strength of the true human understanding which
existed between us, Kamante knew in his heart that I looked
through his tears of contrition and did not take them for
more than they were,— indeed that he himself looked upon

50



KAMAl^TE AND LULU


them more as a ceremony due to the higher powers, than as
any attempt to deceive.

He often referred to himself as a Christian. I did not know
what idea he attached to the name, and once or twice I
tried to catechize him, but then he explained to me that he
believed what I believed, and that, since I myself must know
what I believed, there was no sense in me questioning him.
I found that this was more than an evasion, it was in a way
his positive programme, or confession of faith. He had given
himself under the God of the white people. In His service
he was prepared to carry out any order, but he would not
take upon himself to give reasons for a working system
which might prove to be as unreasonable as the working
systems of the white people themselves.

It sometimes happened that my behaviour clashed with
the teachings of the Scotch Mission, where he had been con-
verted; then he would ask me which was right.

The lack of prejudice in the Natives is a striking thing,
for you expect to find dark taboos in the primitive people.
It is due, I believe, to their acquaintance with a variety of
races and tribes, and to the lively human intercourse that
was brought upon East Africa, first by the old traders of
ivory and slaves, and in our days by the settlers and big-
game hunters. Nearly every Native, down to the little herd-
boys of the plains, has in his day stood face to face with a
whole range of nations as different from one another, and to
him, as a Sicilian to an Esquimo: Englishmen, Jews, Boers,
Arabs, Somali Indians, Swaheli, xMasai and Kavirondo. As
far as receptivity of ideas goes, the Native is more of a man
of the world than the suburban or provincial settler or mis-
sionary, who has grown up in a uniform community and
with a set of stable ideas. Much of the misunderstanding be-

51



OUT OF AFRICA

tween the white people and the Natives arises from this fact.

It is an alarming experience to be, in your person, repre-
senting Christianity to the Natives.

There was a young Kikuyu by the name of Kitau, who
came in from the Kikuyu Reserve and took service with
me. He was a meditative boy, an observant, attentive serv-
ant and I liked him well. After three months he one day
asked me to give him a letter of recommendation to my old
friend Sheik AJi bin Salim, the Lewali of the Coast, at Mom-
basa, for he had seen him in my house and now, he said, he
wished to go and work for him. I did not want Kitau to
leave just when he had learned the routine of the house, and
I said to him that I would rather raise his pay. No, he said,
he was not leaving to get any higher pay, but he could not
stay. He told me that he had made up his mind, up in the
Reserve, that he would become either a Christian or a Mo-
hammedan, only he did not yet know which. For this reason
he had come and worked for me, since I was a Christian,
and he had stayed for three months in my house to see the
testurde,--thQ ways and habits,~of the Christians. From me
he would go for three months to Sheik Ali in Mombasa and
study the testurde of the Mohammedans; then he would de-
cide. I believe that even an Archbishop, when he had had
these facts laid before him, would have said, or at least have
thought, as I said: “Good God, Ktau, you might have told
me that when you came here.”

The Mohammedans will not eat meat of any animal that
has not had its throat cut by a Mohammedan in the ortho-
dox manner. This is often a difficulty on a Safari, where
you carry few provisions with you, and are dependent for
your servants’ food on the game you shoot. When you shoot
a Kongoni and it falls, your Mohammedans rush at it, as upon
wings, to be in time to cut the throat of it before it dies, and

52



KAMANTE AND LULU


yon yourself watch them in suspense, with burning eyes, foi
if they are seen standing over it with hanging arms and
head, it means that the Kongoni has died before they got up
to it, and you will have to stalk another Kongoni, or your
gun-bearers will go starving.

When in the beginning of the war I was going out with
my ox-wagons, the night before I started I happened to
meet the Mohammedan Shereef up at Kijabe; I asked him
if he could not give my people dispensation from the law
for as long as our Safari lasted.

The Shereef was a young man, but wise, and he talked
with Farah and Ismail and pronounced: ‘This lady is a dis-
ciple of Jesus Christ. When she fires off her rifle, she will
say, or at least in her heart say: In the 7mme of God, which
will make her bullets equivalent to the knife of the ortho-
dox Mohammedan. For the length of time of this journey,
you can eat the meat of the animals that she shoots.”

The prestige of the Christian religion in Africa was weak-
ened by the intolerance that the one Christian church showed
towards the other.

On Christmas nights while I was in Africa I used to drive
over to the French IVIission to hear the Midnight Mass. It
was generally hot at this time of the year; as you drove
through the wattle plantation, you heard the chiming of the
Mission bell a long way in the clear warm air. A crowd of
happy, lively people were at the place round the church
when you arrived, the French and Italian shopkeepers of
Nairobi with their families had come out, the nuns from the
convent school were present, and the Native congregation
swarmed in gay clothes. The big fine church was lighted
with many hundred candles and with great transparencies
which the Fathers had themselves made.


53



OUT OF AFRICA

When Christmas came, in the first year after Kamante
had come into my house, I told him that I was going to take
him with me to the Mass, as a fellow Christian, and de-
scribed to him the beautiful things that he was going to see
there, in the manner of the Fathers themselves. Kamante lis-
tened to it all, moved in his soul, and put on the best clothes
he had. But when the car was at the door, he came back in
great agitation of mind and said that he could not possibly
come with me. He did not want to give me his reasons, and
flinched from my questions; in the end it came out. No, he
could not go, he had by now realized that it was to the
French Mission that I meant to take him, and he had been
so strongly warned against that Mission when he had been
in Hospital. I explained to him that this was all a misunder-
standing, and that he must come now. But at that he began
to turn to stone before my eyes, he died, he turned up his
eyes so that only the white showed in them and sweated in
the face.

“No, no, Msabu,” he whispered, “I am not coming with
you. There inside that big church, I know it well, there is
a Msabu who is mbcda terribly bad.

When I heard this I became very sad, but I thought that
now I would indeed have to take him with me so that the
Virgin herself could enlighten him. The Fathers had a life-
size pasteboard statue of the Virgin in their Church, all blue
and white, and the Natives are generally impressed by stat-
ues, while it is difficult to them to conceive the idea of a
picture. So I promised Kamante my protection and took
him with me, and when he walked into the Church, very
close at my heels, he forgot all his scruples. It happened to
be the finest Christmas Mass that they had ever had at the
Mission. There was in the Church a very big Nativity, —a
grotto with the Holy Family, just out from Paris, which was

54



KAMANTE AND LULU


illuminated by radiant stars in a blue sky, and it had round
it a hundred toy animals, wooden cows and pure white
cotton-wool lambs, without any petty consideration as to
their size, that must have raised ecstasy in the hearts of the
Kikuyus.

After Kamante had become a Christian he was no longer
afraid to touch a dead body.

Earlier in his life he had been afraid of it, and when a
man, who had been carried on a stretcher up to the terrace
by my house, died there, he would no more than the others
lend a hand to carry him back; he did not recede, like the
other people, on to the lawn, but he stood immovable upon
the pavement, a little dark monument. Why the Kikuyu,
who personally have so little fear of death, should be so ter-
rified to touch a corpse, while the white people, who are
afraid to die, handle the dead easily, I do not know. Here
once more you feel their reality to be different from our
realities. But all farmers know that here is a domain on
which you cannot control the Native, and that you will save
yourself trouble if you give up the idea at once, for he will
really rather die than change his ways.

Now the terror had disappeared out of Kamante’s heart;
he scorned it in his kinsmen. He did even show off a little
here, as if to boast of the power of his God, It happened
that I had opportunities to test his faith, and that Kamante
and I came to carry three dead people between us, in the
course of our life on the farm. One was a young Kikuyu
girl who was run over by an ox cart outside my house. The
second was a young Kikuyu who was killed while he was
felling trees in the forest- The third was an old white man
who came to live on the farm, played a part in the life of it,
and died there.


55



OUT OF AFRICA

He was a countryman of mine, an old blind Dane by the
name of Knudsen. One day when I was in Nairobi he fumbled
his way up to my car, presented himself, and asked me to
give him a house on my land, as he had no place in the
world to stay in. I had at that time been reducing my staff
of white people on the plantation, and had an empty bunga-
low that I could lend him, and he came out and lived on the
farm for six months.

He was a singular figure to have on a highland farm: so
much a creature of the Sea that it was as if we had had an
old clipped albatross with us. He was all broken by the
hardships of life, and by disease and drink, bent and crooked,
with the curious colouring of redhaired people gone white,
as if he had in reality strewn ashes upon his head, or as if he
was marked by his own element and had been salted. But
there was an unquenchable flame in him which no ashes
could cover. He came of Danish fisherman stock and had
been a sailor, and later one of the very early pioneers of
Africa, —whatever wind it was that blew him there.

Old Knudsen had tried a great many things in his life,
preferably such as have to do with water or fish or birds,
and had done well on none of them. At one time, he told
me, he had owned a very fine fishing concern on Lake Vic-
toria, with many miles of the best fishing nets in the world,
and with a motorboat. But during the war he had lost it all.
In his recounting of this tragedy of his, there was a dark
moment of fatal misunderstanding, or of the treason of a
friend. I do not know which, for the tale was never quite
the same at the various times when it was told to me, and it
brought Old Knudsen into a terrible state of mind when he
came to this point of his recital. There was, all the same,
some real fact in the story, for in compensation of his losses,

56



KAMANTE AND LULU


the Government, while he was staying with me, paid him a
sort of pension of a shilling a day.

All this he told me on the occasions when he came up on
a visit to my house. He often took refuge in me, for he was
uncomfortable in his own bungalow. The small Native boys,
whom I gave him as servants, ran away from him again and
again, because he frightened them by rushing at them blindly,
head foremost, and fumbling with his stick. But when he
was in high spirits he would sit on my verandah over a cup
of coffee and sing Danish patriotic songs to me, all by him-
self, with great energy. It was a pleasure to both him and
me to speak Danish, so we exchanged many remarks over
insignificant happenings on the farm, just for the joy of
talking. But I did not always have patience with him, for
when he had once arrived it was difficult to make him stop
talking and go away; in our daily intercourse he had, as was
to be expected, much of the Ancient Mariner, or of the Old
Man of the Sea.

He had been a great artist at the making of fishing nets,—
the best fishing nets in the world, he told me,—and here, in
the bungalow of the farm, he made kibokos^-tht Native
whips which are cut out of Hippo hide. He would buy a
Hippo hide from the Natives or the farmers up at Lake
Naivasha, and if he was lucky he could make fifty kibokos
out of one hide. I have still a riding-whip which he gave
me; it is a very fine whip. This work spread a terrible stench
round his house, like the stench round the nest of some old
carrion-bird. Later on, when I made a pond on the farm,
he was nearly always to be found by the pond, in deep
thought, with his reflection vertically under him, like a Sea-
bird in a Zoo.

Old Knudsen had in his frail sunken breast the simple,
fierce, irascible, wild heart of a small boy, who burns with

57



OUT OF AFRICA

the unadulterated love of fighting; he was a great romantic
bully and combatant. He was a singularly good hater, al-
ways afire with indignation and rage against nearly all the
people and institutions with which he came in touch; he
called heaven to let fire and brimstone rain down on them,
and “painted the devil on the wall,” as we say in Denmark,
in a Michaelangelesque manner. He was highly delighted
whenever he could set other people by the ears, like a small
boy who sets two dogs fighting, or a dog at a cat. It was an
impressive and formidable thing that Old Kmudsen’s soul
should still, —after his long hard life, and when he had at
last, so to say, been washed into a quiet creek where he
might have lain with his sails slacked,— cry out for opposi-
tion and adversity, like the soul of a boy. It made me respect
it, as the soul of a Berserk.

He never spoke of himself except in the third person, as
“Old Knudsen,” and never without boasting and bragging
to the last degree. There was not a thing in the world that
Old Knudsen would not undertake and carry through, and
not a champion fighter whom Old Knudsen could not knock
down. Wherever other people were concerned, he was a
black pessimist, and he foresaw a near, catastrophic and well
deserved end to all their activities. But on his own behalf he
was a furious optimist. A short time before he died he con-
fided to me, under the promise of secrecy, a tremendous
plan. It would make Old Knudsen, at last, a millionaire and
put all his enemies to shame. He was, he told me, going to
lift, from the bottom of Lake Naivasha, the hundred thou-
sand tons of guano dropped there, from the time of the
creation of the world, by the swimming-birds. In a last colos-
sal effort he made a journey from the farm to Lake Nai-
vasha, to study and work out the details of his plan. He died
in the lustre of it. The scheme had in it all the elements dear

58



KAMANTE AND LULU


to his heart: deep water, birds, hidden treasures; it had even
a flavour of the things that one ought not to talk to ladies
about. At the top of it he saw, with the eyes of his mind,
triumphant Old Knudsen himself, with a trident, control-
ling the waves. I do not remember if he ever explained to
me how the guano was to be brought up from the bottom
of the Lake.

The great exploits and achievements of Old Knudsen and
his eminence in everything, as he reported these things to
me, were clearly at variance with the weakness and impo-
tency of the old man who reported them; in the end you
felt that you were dealing with two separate and essentially
different individualities. The mighty figure of Old Knudsen
rose in the background, unbeaten and triumphant, the hero
of all the adventures, and it was his old bent and worn serv-
ant whom I knew, and who never tired of telling me about
him. This little, humble man had made it his mission in life
to uphold and extol the name of Old Knudsen, even to
death. For he had really seen Old Knudsen, which nobody
else except God ever had, and after that he would stand no
heresy in anyone.

One single time have I heard him make use of the first
personal pronoun. This was a couple of months before he
died. He had had a bad heart-attack, the same thing that
killed him in the end, and when I had not seen him on the
farm for a week I went down to his bungalow to get news
of him, and I found him, in the middle of the stench from
the Hippo hide, in bed in a very bare and untidy room. He
was ashen grey in the face, his dim eyes were sunk deep
back. He did not answer me or speak a word when I spoke
to him. Only after a long time, and when I had already got
up to go away, he suddenly said in a small hoarse voice, “I
am very sick.’’ At that time there was no talk of Old Knud-

59



OUT OF AFRICA

sen, who surely was never ill or overcome; it was the serv-
ant, who just for once allowed himself to express his indi-
vidual misery and anguish.

Old Knudsen was dull on the farm, so from time to time
he locked the door of his house, made off and disappeared
from our horizon. It was most often, I think, when he had
had news that an old friend, some other pioneer of the glori-
ous past, had arrived in Nairobi. He would stay away, for a
week or a fortnight, until we had half forgotten his exist-
ence, and he always came back so terribly ill and worn out
that he could hardly drag himself along, or unlock his door.
He then kept to himself for a couple of days. I believe that
on these occasions he was afraid of me, for he thought that
I would be sure to have disapproved of his escapades, and
that I would now profit by his weakness to triumph over
him. Old Knudsen, although he would sometimes sing of the
sailor’s bride who loves the waves, in his heart had a deep
mistrust of woman, and saw her as the enemy of man, by
instinct, and on principle, out to stop his fun.

On the day of his death he had in this way been absent
for a fortnight, and nobody on the farm was aware that he
had come back. But he himself must this time have meant to
make an exception from his rule, for he had been on the
way from his own house to mine, by a path which ran
through the plantation, when he fell down and died. Ka-
mante and I found him lying on the path as, late in the after-
noon, we were going out to look for mushrooms on the
plain, in the new short grass, for it was April, in the begin-
ning of the long rains.

It was befitting that it should be Kamante who found him,
for, alone of all the Natives of the farm, he had shown Old
Knudsen sympathy. He had even taken an interest in him,
6o



KAMANTE AND LULU


as one deviation from the normal in another, and from time
to time of his own accord had brought him eggs, and kept
an eye on his Totos, which had prevented them from run-
ning away altogether.

The old man lay on his back, his hat had rolled a little
away when he fell, his eyes w^ere not quite closed. In death
he looked essentially collected. There you are at last, Old
Knudsen,— I thought.

I wanted to carry him to his house, but I knew that it
would be of no use to call in any of the Kikuyus who might
be about, or working in their own shambas close by, to help
me; they would only run away immediately when they saw
why I had called them. I ordered Kamante to run back to
the house and fetch down Farah to assist me. But Kamante
did not move.

“Why do you want me to run?” he asked.

“Well you see yourself,” I said, “that I cannot carry the
old Bwana alone, and you Kikuyus are fools, you are afraid
to carry a dead man.”

Kamante set up his little mocking noiseless laughter. “You
again forget, Msabu,” he said, “that I am a Cluristian.”

He lifted the old man’s feet while I bore his head, and be-
tween us we carried him to his bungalow. From time to
time we had to stop, lay him down, and rest; then Kamante
stood up erect and looked straight down at Old Knudsen’s
feet, with what I think will have been the Scotch Mission
manner in the presence of death.

As we had laid him on his bed, Kamante went about the
room, and into the kitchen, in search of a towel to cover his
face with,— he only found an old newspaper. “The Chris-
tians did that at the Hospital,” he explained to me.

A long time afterwards Kamante had great satisfaction
out of the thought of this instance of my ignorance. He

6i



OUT OF AFRICA

would work with me in the kitchen, filled with a secret
pleasure, and suddenly break out laughing. “Do you remem-
ber, Msabu,” he said, “the time when you had forgotten
that I was a Christian, and thought that I should be afraid to
help you to carry the Msungu the old white man.

Kamante as a Christian was no longer afraid of snakes. I
heard him state to the other boys that a Christian might at
any moment put his heel upon the head of the largest snake
and crush it. I have not seen him try to do so, but I saw him
standing very still, with a set face and his hands behind his
back, within a short distance of the Cook’s hut when a puff-
adder had appeared on its roof. All the children of my
household spread in large circles around it, like chaff before
the wind, with wild wails, while Far ah went into the house
to fetch my gun, and shot the puff-adder.

When it was all over, and the waves had settled down
again, Nyore, the Sice’s son, said to Kamante: “Why, you
Kamante, did you not set your heel upon the head of the
big bad snake and crush it?”

“Because it was up on the roof,” said Kamante,

At one time, I tried to shoot with a bow and arrow. I was
strong, but it was difficult to me to bend the Wanderobo
bow which Farah had got for me; still in the end, and after
long practice, I became skilful as an archer.

Kamante was very small then, he used to watch me when
I was shooting on the lawn, and seemed doubtful about the
undertaking, and one day said to me: “Are you a Christian
still when you are shooting with a bow? I thought that the
Christian way was with a rifle.”

I showed him in my pictorial Bible an illustration to the
62



KAMANTE AND LULU


tale of Hagar’s son: “And God was with the lad; and he
grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.”

“Well,” said Kamante, “he was like you.”

Kamante had a good hand with sick animals, as with my
Native patients. He took out splinters from the dogs’ feet,
and once cured one of them when it had been bitten by a
snake.

For some time I had in the house a stork with a broken
wing. He was a decided character, he walked through the
rooms and when he came into my bedroom he fought tre-
mendous duels, as with the rapier, with swaggering and
flapping of wings, with his image in my looking-glass. He fol-
lowed Kamante about between the houses, and it was im-
possible not to believe that he was deliberately imitating
Kamante’s stiff measured walk. Their legs were about the
same thickness. The little Native boys had an eye for carica-
ture and shouted with joy when they saw the pair pass.
Kamante understood the joke, but he never paid much at-
tention to what other people thought of him. He sent off the
little boys to collect frogs for the stork in the bogs.

It was also Kamante who had charge of Lulu.

Lulu came to my house from the woods as Kamante had
come to it from the plains.

To the East of my farm lay the Ngong Forest Reserve,
which then was nearly all Virgin Forest. To my mind it
was a sad thing when the old forest was cut down, and Eu-
calyptus and Grevillea planted in its place; it might have
made a unique pleasure-ground and park for Nairobi.

An African Native Forest is a mysterious region. You ride
into the depths of an old tapestry, in places faded and in
others darkened with age, but marvellously rich in green
shades. You cannot see the sky at all in there, but the sun-
light plays in many strange ways, falling through the foli-
age. The grey fungus, like long drooping beards, on the
trees, and the creepers hanging down everywhere, give a
secretive, recondite air to the Native forest. I used to ride
here with Farah on Sundays, when there was nothing to do
on the farm, up and down the slopes, and across the little
win din g forest-streams. The air in the forest was cool like
water, and filled with the scent of plants, and in the be-
ginning of the long rains when the creepers flowered, you
rode through sphere after sphere of fragrance. One kind of
African Daphne of the woods, which flowers with a small
64



KAMANTE AND LULU


cream-coloured sticky blossom, had an overwhelming sweet
perfume, like lilac, and wild lily of the valley. Here and
there, hollow tree-stems were hung up in ropes of hide on a
branch; the Kikuyu hung them there to make the bees build
in them, and to get honey. Once as we turned a corner in the
forest, we saw a leopard sitting on the road, a tapestry animal.

Here, high above the ground, lived a garrulous restless
nation, the little grey monkeys. Where a pack of monkeys
had travelled over the road, the smell of them lingered for a
long time in the air, a dry and stale, mousy smell. As you
rode on you would suddenly hear the rush and whizz over
your head, as the colony passed along on its own ways. If
you kept still in the same place for some time you might
catch sight of one of the monkeys sitting immovable in a
tree, and, a little after, discover that the whole forest round
you was alive with his family, placed like fruits on the
branches, grey or dark figures according to how the sun-
light fell on them, all with their long tails hanging down be-
hind them. They gave out a peculiar sound, like a smacking
kiss with a little cough to follow it; if from the ground you
imitated it, you saw the monkeys turn their heads from one
side CO the other in an affected manner, but if you made a
sudden movement they were all off in a second, and you
could follow the decreasing swash as they clove the tree-
tops, and disappeared in the wood like a shoal of fishes in
the waves.

In the Ngong Forest I have also seen, on a narrow path
through thick growth, in the middle of a very hot day, the
Giant Forest Hog, a rare person to meet. He came suddenly
past me, with his wife and three young pigs, at a great speed,
the whole family looking like uniform, bigger and smaller
figures cut out in dark paper, against the sunlit green behind

65



OUT OF AFRICA

them. It was a glorious sight, like a reflection in a forest
pool, like a thing that had happened a thousand years ago.

Lulu was a young antelope of the bushbuck tribe, which
is perhaps the prettiest of all the African antelopes. They are
a little bigger than the fallow-deer; they live in the woods,
or in the bush, and are shy and fugitive, so that they are not
seen as often as the antelopes of the plains. But the Ngong
Hills, and the surrounding country, were good places for
bushbuck, and if you had your camp in the hills, and were
out hunting in the early morning, or at sunset, you would
see them come out of the bush into the glades, and as the
rays of the sun fell upon them their coats shone red as cop-
per. The male has a pair of delicately turned horns.

Lulu became a member of my household in this way:

I drove one morning from the farm to Nairobi. My mill
on the farm had burnt down a short time before, and I had
had to drive into town many times to get the insurance set-
tled and paid out; in this early morning I had my head filled
with figures and estimates. As I came driving along the
Ngong Road a little group of Kikuyu children shouted to
me from the roadside, and I saw that they were holding a
very small bushbuck up for me to see. I knew that they
would have found the fawn in the bush, and that now they
wanted to sell it to me, but I was late for an appointment in
Nairobi, and I had no thought for this sort of thing, so I
drove on.

Wlien I was coming back in the evening and was driving
past the same place, there was again a great shout from the
side of the road and the small party was still there, a little
tired and disappointed, for they may have tried to sell the
fawn to other people passing by in the course of the day,
but keen now to get Ae deal through before the sun was
66



KAMANTE AND LULU

down, and they held xip the fawn high to tempt me. But I
had had a long day in town, and some adversity about the
insurance, so that I did not care to stop or talk, and I just
drove on past them. I did not even think of them when I
was back in my house, and dined and went to bed.

The moment that I had fallen asleep I was woken up again
by a great feeling of terror. The picture of the boys and
the small buck, which had now collected and taken shape,
stood out before me, clearly, as if it had been painted, and I
sat up in bed as appalled as if someone had been trying to
choke me. What, I thought, would become of the fawn in
the hands of the captors who had stood with it in the
heat of the long day, and had held it up by its joined legs?
It was surely too young to eat on its own. I myself had
driven past it twice on the same day, like the priest and the
Levite in one, and had given no thought to it, and now, at
this moment, where was it? I got up in a real panic and
woke up all my houseboys. I told them that the fawn must
be found and brought me in the morning, or they would all
of them get their dismissal from my service. They were im-
mediately up to the idea. Two of my boys had been in the
car with me the same day, and had not shown the slightest
interest in the children or the fawn; now they came for-
ward, and gave the others a long list of details of the place
and the hour and of the family of the boys. It was a moon-
light night; my people all took off and spread in the land-
scape in a lively discussion of the situation; I heard them
expatiating on the fact that they were all to be dismissed in
case the bushbuck were not found.

Early next morning when Farah brought me in my tea,
Juma came in with him and carried the fawn in his arms.
It was a female, and we named her Lulu, which I was told
was the Swaheli word for a pearl.


'67



OUT OF AFRICA

Lulu by that time was only as big as a cat, with large
quiet purple eyes. She had such delicate legs that you feared
they would not bear being folded up and unfolded again,
as she lay down and rose up. Her ears were smooth as silk
and exceedingly expressive. Her nose was as black as a truf-
fle. Her diminutive hoofs gave her all the air of a young
Chinese lady of the old school, with laced feet. It was a rare
experience to hold such a perfect thing in your hands.

Lulu soon adapted herself to the house and its inhabitants
and behaved as if she were at home. During the first weeks
the polished floors in the rooms were a problem in her life,
and when she got outside the carpets her legs went away
from her to all four sides; it looked catastrophic but she did
not let it worry her much and in the end she learnt to walk
on the bare floors with a sound like a succession of little
angry finger-taps. She was extraordinarily neat in all her
habits. She was headstrong already as a child, but when I
stopped her from doing the things she wanted to do, she be-
haved as if she said: Anything rather than a scene.

Kamante brought her up on a sucking-bottle, and he also
shut her up at night, for we had to be careful of her as the
leopards were up round the house after nightfall. So she
held to him and followed him about. From time to time
when he did not do what she wanted, she gave his thin legs
a hard butt with her young head, and she was so pretty that
you could not help, when you looked upon the two to-
gether, seeing them as a new paradoxical illustration to the
tale of the Beauty and the Beast. On the strength of this
great beauty and gracefulness, Lulu obtained for herself a
commanding position in the house, and was treated with re-
spect by all.

In Africa I never had dogs of any other breed than the
Scotch Deerhound. There is no more noble or gracious kind
68



KAMANTE AND LULU


of dog. They must have lived for many centuries with men
to understand and fall in with our life and its conditions the
way they do. You will also find them in old paintings and
tapestries, and they have in themselves a tendency to change,
by their looks and manners, their surroundings into tapes-
try; they bring with them a feudal atmosphere.

The first of my tribe of deerhounds, who was named
Dusk, had been given to me as a wedding-present, and had
come out with me when I began my life in Africa, on “The
Mayflower,” so to say. He was a gallant, generous charac-
ter. He accompanied me when, during the first months of the
war, I did transport for the Government, with ox-waggons
in the Masai Reserve. But a couple of years later he was
killed by Zebra. By the time that Lulu came to live in my
house I had two of his sons there.

The Scotch Deerhound went well with African scenery
and the African Native. It may be due to the altitude,— the
highland melody in all three,— for he did not look so har-
monious at Sea-level in Mombasa. It was as if the great,
spare landscape, with the plains, hills and rivers, was not
complete until the deerhounds were also in it. All the deer-
hounds were great hunters and had more nose than the
greyhounds, but they hunted by sight and it was a highly
wonderful thing to see two of them working together. I
took them with me when I was out riding in the Game Re-
serve, which I was not allowed to do, and there they would
spread the herds of Zebra and Wildebeest over the plain, as
if it were all the stars of heaven running wild over the sky.
But when I was out in the Masai Reserve shooting I never
lost a wounded head of game, if I had the deerhounds with
me.

They looked well in the Native forests too, dark grey in
the sombre green shades. One of them, in here, all by him-

OUT OF AFRICA

self, killed a big old male baboon, and in the fight had his
nose bitten straight through, which spoilt his noble profile
but by everybody on the farm was considered an honourable
scar, for the baboons are destructive beasts and the Natives
detest them.

The deerhounds were very wise, and knew who amongst
my houseboys were Mohammedans, and not allowed to
touch dogs.

During my first years in Africa I had a Somali gunbearer
named Ismail, who died while I was still out there. He was'
one of the old time gunbearers and there are no such people
now. He had been brought up by the great old big-game
hunters of the beginning of the century, when all Africa
was a real deer-park. His acquaintance with civilization was
entirely of the hunting fields, and he spoke an English of the
hunting world, so that he would talk of my big and my
young rifle. After Ismail had gone back to Somaliland, I had
a letter from him which was addressed to Lioness Blixen,
and opened: Honourable Lioness. Ismail was a strict Mo-
hammedan, and would not for the life of him touch a dog,
which caused him much worry in his profession. But he
made an exception with Dusk and never minded my taking
him with us in mule-trap, he would even let Dusk sleep in
his tent. For Dusk, he said, would know a Mohammedan
When he saw him, and would never touch Tiim. Indeed,
Ismail assured me, Dusk could see at once who was a sin-
cere Mohammedan at heart. He once said to me: “I know
now that the Dusk is of the same tribe as you yourself. He
laughs at the people.”

Now my dogs understood Lulu’s power and position in
the house. The arrogance of the great hunters was like
water with her. She pushed them away from the milk-bowl
and from their favourite places in front of the fire. I had
70



KAMANTE AND LULU


tied a small bell on a rein round Lulu’s neck, and there came
a time when the dogs, when they heard the jingle of it ap-
proaching through the rooms, would get up resignedly from
their warm beds by the fireplace, and go and lie down in
some other part of the room. Still nobody could be of a
gentler demeanour than Lulu was when she came and lay
down, in the manner of a perfect lady who demurely
gathers her skirts about her and will be in no one’s way.
She drank the milk with a polite, pernickety mien, as if she
had been pressed by an overkind hostess. She insisted on
being scratched behind the ears, in a pretty forbearing way,
like a young wife who pertly permits her husband a caress.

When Lulu grew up and stood in the flower of her young
loveliness she was a slim delicately rounded doe, from her
nose to her toes unbelieveably beautiful. She looked like a
minutely painted illustration to Heine’s song of the wise and
gentle gazelles by the flow of the river Ganges.

But Lulu was not really gentle, she had the so called devil
in her. She had, to the highest degree, the feminine trait of
appearing to be exclusively on the defensive, concentrated
on guarding the integrity of her being, when she was really,
with every force in her, bent upon the offensive. Against
whom? Against the whole world. Her moods grew beyond
control or computation, and she would go for my horse, if
he displeased her. I remembered old Hagenbeck in Ham-
burg, who had said that of all animal races, the carnivora
included, the deer are the least to be relied on, and that you
may trust a leopard, but if you trust a young stag, sooner
or later he falls upon you in the rear.

Lulu was the pride of the house even when she behaved
like a real shameless young coquette; but we did not make
her happy. Sometimes she walked away from the house for
hours, or for a whole afternoon. Sometimes when the spirit

71



OUT OF AFRICA

came upon her and her discontent with her surroundings
reached a climax, she would perform, for the satisfaction of
her own heart, on the lawn in front of the house, a war-
dance, which looked like a brief zig-zagged prayer to Satan.

“Oh Lulu,'' I thought, “I know that you are marvellously
strong and that you can leap higher than your own height.
You are furious with us now, you wish that we were all
dead, and indeed we should be so if you could be bothered
to kill us. But the trouble is not as you think now, that we
have put up obstacles too high for you to jump, and how
could we possibly do that, you great leaper? It is that we
have put up no obstacles at all. The great strength is in you.
Lulu, and the obstacles are within you as well, and the
thing is, that the fullness of time has not yet come.”

One evening Lulu did not come home and we looked out
for her in vain for a week. This was a hard blow to us all.
A clear note had gone out of the house and it seemed no
better than other houses. I thought of the leopards by the
river and one evening I talked about them to Kamante.

As usual he waited some time before he answered, to
digest my lack of insight. It was not till a few days later
that he approached me upon the matter. “You believe that
Lulu is dead, Msabu,” he said.

I did not like to say so straight out, but I told him I was
wondering why she did not come back.

“Lulu,” said Kamante, “is not dead. But she is married.”

This was pleasant, surprising, news, and I asked him how
he knew of it.

“Oh yes,” he said, “she is married. She lives in the forest
with her her husband, or master. “But she has not

forgotten the people; most mornings she is coming back to
the house. I lay out crushed maize to her at the back of the
kitchen, then just before the sun comes up, she walks round

72



KAMANTE AND LULU


there from the woods and eats it. Her husband is with her,
but he is afraid of the people because he has never known
them. He stands below the big white tree by the other side
of the lawn. But up to the houses he dare not come.”

I told Kamante to come and fetch me when he next saw
Lulu. A few days later before sunrise he came and called
me out.

It was a lovely morning. The last stars withdrew while
we were waiting, the sky was clear and serene but the
world in which we walked was sombre still, and profoundly
silent. The grass was wet; down by the trees where the
ground sloped it gleamed with the dew like dim silver. The
air of the morning was cold, it had that twinge in it which
in Northern countries means that the frosf is not far away.
However often you make the experience,—! thought,— it is
still impossible to believe, in this coolness and shade, that
the heat of the sun and the glare of the sky, in a few hours’
time, will be hard to bear. The grey mist lay upon the hills,
strangely taking shape from them; it would be bitterly cold
on the Buffalo if they were about there now, grazing on the
hillside, as in a cloud.

The great vault over our heads was gradually filled with
clarity like a glass with wine. Suddenly, gently, the sum^
mits of the hill caught the first sunlight and blushed. And
slowly, as the earth leaned towards the sun, the grassy slopes
at the foot of the mountain turned a delicate gold, and the
Masai woods lower down. And now the tops of the tall
trees in the forest, on our side of the river, blushed like
copper. This was the hour for the flight of the big, purple
wood-pigeons which roosted by the other side of the river
and came over to feed on the Cape-chestnuts in my forest.
They were here only for a short season in the year. The
birds came surprisingly fast, like a cavalry attack of the air,

73



OUT OF AFRICA

For this reason the morning pigeon-shooting on the farm
was popular with my friends in Nairobi; to be out by the
house in time, just as the sun rose, they used to come out so
early that they rounded my drive with the lamps of their
cars still lighted.

Standing like this in the limpid shadow, looking up
towards the golden heights and the clear sky, you would
get the feeling that you were in reality walking along the
bottom of the Sea, with the currents running by you, and
were gazing up towards the surface of the Ocean.

A bird began to sing, and then I heard, a little way off in
the forest, the tinkling of a bell. Yes, it was a joy. Lulu was
back, and about in her old places! It came nearer, I could
follow her movements by its rhythm; she was walking,
stopping, walking on again. A turning round one of the
boys’ huts brought her upon us. It suddenly became an
unusual and amusing thing to see a bushbuck so close to the
house. She stood immovable now, she seemed to be prepared
for the sight of Kamante, but not for that of me. But she
did not make off, she looked at me without fear and with-
out any remembrance of our skirmishes of the past or of
her own ingratitude in running away without warning.

Lulu of the woods was a superior, independent being, a
change of heart had come upon her, she was in possession.
If I had happened to have known a young princess in exile,
and while she was still a pretender to the throne, and had
met her again in her full queenly estate after she had come
into her rights, our meeting would have had the same char-
acter. Lulu showed no more meanness of heart than King
Louis Philippe did, when he declared that the King of
France did not remember the grudges of the Duke of
Orleans. She was now the complete Lulu. The spirit of of-
fensive had gone from her; for whom, and why, should

74



KAMANTE AND LULU

she attack? She was standing quietly on her divipe rights.
She remembered me enough to feel that I was nothing to be
afraid of. For a minute she gazed at me; her purple srrioky
eyes were absolutely without expression and did mot wink,
and I remembered that the Gods or Goddesses ne^er.wink,
and felt that I was face to face with the ox-eyed Hera, She
lightly nipped a leaf of grass as she passed me, made one
pretty little leap, and walked on to the back of the kitchen,
where Kamante had spread maize on the ground.

Kamante touched my arm with one finger and then
pointed it towards the ’woods. As I followed the direction,
I saw, under a tall Cape-chestnut-tree, a male bushbuck, a
small tawny silhouette at the outskirt of the forest, with a
fine pair of horns, immovable like a tree-stem. Kamante ob-
served him for some time, and then laughed. ^7

“Look here now,” he said, “Lulu has explained to het
husband that there is nothing up by the houses to be afraid
of, but all the same he dares not come. Every morning he
thinks that to-day he will come all the way, but, when he
sees the house and the people, he gets a cold stone in the
stomach,”— this is a common thing in the Native world, and
often gets in the way of the work on the farm, -“and then
he stops by the tree.”

For a long time Lulu came to the house in the early
mornings. Her clear bell announced that the sun was up on
the hills, I used to lie in bed, and wait for it. Sometimes she
stayed away for a week or two, and we missed her and
began to talk of the people who went to shoot in the hills.
But then again my houseboys announced: “Lulu is here,”
as if it had been the married daughter of the house on a visit.
A few times more I also saw the bushbuck’s silhouette
amongst the trees, but Kamante had been right, and he never
collected enough courage to come all the way to the house.

7 ^

like copper. One of them was Lulu, for she came up near
to the house, and walked about sedately, pricking her ears
when a car arrived, or when we opened a window; and the
dogs would know her. She became darker in colour with
age. Once I came driving up in front of my house with a
friend and found three bushbucks on the terrace there,
round the salt that was laid out for my cows.

It was a curious thing that apart from the first big bush-
buck, Lulu’s bwana, who had stood under the Cape-chestnut
with his head up, no male bushbuck was amongst the ante-
lopes that came to my house. It seemed that we had to do
with a forest matriarchy.

The hunters and naturalists of the Colony took an interest
in my bushbucks, and the Game Warden drove out to the
farm to see them, and did see them there. A correspondent
wrote about them in the East African Standard,

The years in which Lulu and her people came round to
my house were the happiest of my life in Africa. For that
reason, I came to look upon my acquaintance with the forest
antelopes as upon a great boon, and a token of friendship
from Africa. All the country was in it, good omens, old
covenants, a song:

“Make haste, my beloved and be thou like to a roe
or to a young hart upon the mountain of spices.”

During my last years in Africa I saw less and less of Lulu
and her family. Within the year before I went away I do
not think that they ever came. Things had changed, South
of my farm land had been given out to farmers and the
forest had been cleared here, and houses built. Tractors were
heaving up and down where the glades had been. Many of
the new settlers were keen sportsmen and the rifles sang in

78



KAMANTE AND LULU


the landscape. I believe that the game withdrew to the West
and went into the woods of the Masai Reserve.

I do not know how long an antelope lives, probably Lulu
has died a long time ago.

Often, very often, in the quiet hours of daybreak, I have
dreamed that I have heard Lulu’s clear bell, and in my sleep
my heart has run full of joy, I have woken up expecting
something very strange and sweet to happen, just now, in a
moment.

When I have then lain and thought of Lulu, I have won-
dered if in her life in the woods she ever dreamed of the
bell. Would there pass in her mind, like shadows upon
water, pictures of people and dogs?

If I know a song of Africa,—! thought,— of the Giraffe,
and the African new moon lying on her back, of the ploughs
in the fields, and the sweaty faces of the coffee-pickers, does
Africa know a song of me? Would the air over the plain
quiver with a colour that I had had on, or the children in-
vent a game in which my name was, or the full moon throw
a shadow over the gravel of the drive that was like me, or
would the eagles of Ngong look out for me?

I have not heard from Lulu, since I went away, but from
Kamante I have heard, and from my other houseboys in
Africa. It is not more than a month since I had the last let-
ter from him. But these communications from Africa come
to me in a strange, unreal way, and are more like shadows,
or mirages, than like news of a reality.

For Kamante cannot write, and he does not know English.
When he, or my other people, take it into their heads to
send me their tidings, they go to one of the professional
Indian or Native letter- writers who are sitting with their
writing desk, paper, pen and ink, outside the -Post Offices,
and explain to them what shall be in the letter. The pro-

79



OUT OF AFRICA

fessional writers do not know much English either, and can
hardly be said to know how to write, but they themselves
believe that they can. To show off their skill they enrich
the letters with a number of flourishes, which makes them
difficult to decipher. They have also a habit of writing the
letters in three or four different kinds of ink, and, whatever
their motive for this is, it gives the impression that they are
short of ink and are squeezing the last drop out of a number
of ink-bottles. From all these efforts come the sort of mes-
sages that people got from the Oracle of Delphi. There is a
depth in the letters that I get, you feel that there is some
vital communication which has been heavy on the heart of
the sender, which had made him walk in a long way from
the Elikuyu Reserve to the Post Office. But it is wrapped up
in darkness. The cheap and dirty little sheet of paper that,
when it comes to you, has travelled many thousand miles,
seems to speak and speak, even to scream to you, but it tells
you nothing at all.

Kamante, however, in this as in most other ways was dif-
ferent from other people. As a correspondent he has a
maimer of his own. He puts three or four letters into the
same envelope, and has them marked: ist Letter, 2nd Letter,
and so on. They all contain the same things, repeated over
and over. Perhaps he wants to make a deeper impression
upon me by repetition, he had that way in talking when
there was anything that he particularly wanted me to un-
derstand or remember. Perhaps it is difficult for him to
break off when he feels that he has got into contact with a
friend at such a great distance.

Kamante writes that he has been out of work for a long
time. I was not surprised to hear of it, for he was really
caviare to the general. I had educated a Royal Cook and
left him in a new Colony. It was with him a case of “Open

80



KAMANTE AND LULU


Sesame”. Now the word has been lost, and the stone has
closed for good round the mystic treasures that it had in it.
Where the great Chef walked in deep thought, full of
knowledge, nobody sees anything but a little bandy-legged
Kikuyu, a dwarf with a flat, still face.

What has Kamante got to say when he walks in to
Nairobi, takes up his stand before the greedy supercilious
Indian letter-writer, and expounds to him a message that is
to go round half the world? The lines are crooked and
there is no order in the phrases of the letter. But Kamante
had in him a greatness of soul of which the people who
knew him will still hear the note in the cracked disordered
music, even as an echo of the harp of the herdboy David.

This is a “2nd letter”:

“I was not forget you Memsahib. Honoured Memsahib.
Now all your servants they never glad because you was
from the country. If we was bird we fly and see you. Then
we turn. Then your old farm it was good place for cow
small calf black people. Now they had no anything cows
goat sheep they has no anything. Now all bad people they
enjoy in their heart because your old servant they come
poor people now. Now God know in his heart all this to
help sometime your servant.”

And in a “3rd letter” Kamante gives an example of the
way in which the Native can say a handsome thing to you,
he writes:

“Write and tell us if you turn. We think you turn. Be-
cause why? We think that you shall never can forget us.
Because why? We think that you remembered still all our
face and our mother names.”

A white man who wanted to say a pretty thing to you
would write: “I can never forget you.” The African says:
“We do not think of you, that you can ever forget us.”

the et^ening of the nineteenth of December,
I walked out of my house before going to bed,
to see if there was any rain coming. Many farmers in the
highlands were, I believe, doing the same thing at that hour.
Sometimes, in a lucky year, we would get a few heavy
showers just round Christmas, and it was a great thing for
the young coffee, which has set on the trees after the
flowering in the short rains of October. This night there
was no sign of rain. The sky was serene and silently tri-
umphant, resplendent with stars.

The Stellar Heaven of the Equator is richer than that of
the North, and you see it more because you are out more
at night. In Northern Europe, winter nights are too cold
to allow one much pleasure in the contemplation of the
stars, and in summer one hardly distinguishes them within
the clear night sky, that is as pale as a dog-violet.

The tropical night has the companionability of a Roman
Catholic Cathedral compared to the Protestant Churches
of the North, which let you in on business only. Here in
the great room everybody comes and goes, this is the place
where things are going on. To Arabia and Africa, where
the sun of the midday kills you, night is the time for trav-

elling and enterprise. The stars have been named here, they
have been guides to human beings for many centuries, draw-
ing them in long lines across the desert-sands and the Sea,
one towards the East, and another to the West, or the North
and South. Cars run well at night, and it is pleasant to motor
under the stars, you get into the habit of fixing visits to
friends up-country by the time of the next full moon. You
start Safaris by the new moon, to have the benefit of the
whole row of moonlight nights. It is then strange, when
back on a visit to Europe, to find your friends of the towns
living out of touch with the moves of the moon and almost
in ignorance of them. The young moon was the sign of
action to IChadija’s camel man, whose Caravan was to start
off when she appeared in the sky. With his face towards
her he was one of the “Philosophers who spin out of moon-
light systems of the Universe”. He must have looked at her
much, that he made her his sign in which to conquer.

I had got a name amongst the Natives, because a number
of times I had happened to be, on the farm, the first to see
the new moon, like a thin silver bow in the sunset; par-
ticularly because, two or three years running, I had been
the first to catch sight of the new moon of the month of
Ramadan, the Mohammedan’s holy Month.

The farmer slowly turns his eyes all round the Horizon,
First to the East, for from the East, if it comes, comes the
rain, and there stands clear Spica in the Virgin. Then South,

West above the faint outline of the Ngong Hills, now nearly

and Bellatrix. He turns to the North last, for to the North
we go back in the end, and there he runs upon the Great Beat
himself, only he is now calmly standing on his head on ac-
count of the heavenly perspective, and that has all the air
of a bearish joke, that cheers the heart of the Nordic emi-
grant.

People who dream when they sleep at night, know of a
special kind of happiness which the world of the day holds
not, a placid ecstasy, and ease of heart, that are like honey
on the tongue. They also know that the real glory of
dreams lies in their atmosphere of unlimited freedom. It is
not the freedom of the dictator, who enforces his own will
on the world, but the freedom of the artist, who has no
will, who is free of will. The pleasure of the true dreamer
does not lie in the substance of the dream, but in this: that
there things happen without any interference from his side,
and altogether outside his control. Great landscapes create.,
themselves, long splendid views, rich and delicate colours,
roads, houses, which he has never seen or heard of. Strangers
appear and are friends or enemies, although the person who
dreams has never done anything about them. The ideas of
flight and pursuit are recurrent in dreams and are equally
enrapturing. Excellent witty things are said by everybody.
It is true that if remembered in the daytime they will fade
and lose their sense, because they belong to a different
plane, but as soon as the one who dreams lies down at night,
the current is again closed and he remembers their excel-
lency. All the time the feeling of immense freedom is sur-
rounding him and running through him like air and light, an
unearthly bliss. He is a privileged person, the one who has
got nothing to do, but for whose enrichment and pleasure
all things are brought together; the Kings of Tarshish shall
bring gifts. He takes part in a great battle or ball, and won-

ders the while that he should be, in the midst of those events,
so far privileged as to be lying down. It is when one begins
to lose the consciousness of freedom, and when the idea of
necessity enters the world at all, when there is any hurry
or strain anywhere, a letter to be written or a train to catch,
when you have got to work, to make the horses of the
dream gallop, or to make the rifles go oflF, that the dream
is declining, and turning into the nightmare, which belongs
to the poorest and most vulgar class of dreams.

The thing which in the waking world comes nearest to a
dream is night in a big town, where nobody knows one, or
the African night. There too is infinite freedom: it is there
that things are going on, destinies are made round you,
there is activity to all sides, and it is none of your concern.

Here now, as soon as the sun was down the air was full
of bats, cruising as noiselessly as cars upon asphalt, the
night-hawk swept past too: the bird that sits on the road
and in the eyes of which the lights of your car gleam red a
moment before he flutters up vertically in front of your
wheels. The little spring-hares were out on the roads, mov-
ing in their own way, sitting down suddenly and jumping
along to a rhythm, like miniature Kangaroos. The Cicada
sing an endless song in the long grass, smells run along the
earth and falling stars run over the sky, like tears over a
cheek. You are the privileged person to whom everything is
taken. The Kings of Tarshish shall bring gifts.

A few miles out, in the Masai Reserve, the Zebra are now
changmg their pasture, the flocks wander over the grey
plain like lighter stripes upon it, the Buffalo are out grazing
on the long slopes of the Hills. My young men of the farm
would come by, two or three together, walking one after
the other like narrow dark shadows on the lawn, they were
afoot and aiming straight at their own object, they were not

working for me, and it was none of my concern. They
themselves accentuated the position by just slackening their
pace as they caught sight of my burning cigarette-end out-
side the house, and saluting without stopping.

^^Jambo Msabu.”

^^Jambo Morani”— young warriors,— ^‘where are you
going?”

‘TVe are going to Kathegu’s manyatta. Kathegu has a big
Ngoma on to-night. Good-bye Alsabu.”

If they walk together in bigger parties they will bring
their own drum to the dance, and you hear it a long way
away, like the throbbing of a small pulse in the finger of
the night. And suddenly, to the ear that has not been listen-
ing for it, comes what is not so much a sound as a deep
vibration of the air, the distant short roar of the lion. He is
afoot, he is hunting, things are going on, out there where
he is. It is not repeated, but it has widened the horizon; the
long dungas and the waterhole are brought to you.

As I was standing before my house a shot fell, not far off.
One shot. Then again the stillness of the night closed on all
sides. After a while, as if they had been pausing to listen
and were now taking it up once more, I heard the Cicada
chiming their monotonous little song in the grass.

There is something strangely determinate and fatal about
a single shot in the night. It is as if someone had cried a
message to you in one word, and would not repeat it. I
stood for some time wondering what it had meant. Nobody
could aim at anything at this hour, and, to scare away some-
thing, a person wmuld fire two shots or more.

It might have been my old Indian carpenter Poor an Singh
down at the mill, firing at a couple of Hyena that had slunk
into the millyard and were eating the straps of oxhide hung

up there, with stones as weights to them, to be made into
reins for our waggons. Pooran Singh was no hero, but he
might have put the door of his hut ajar for the sake of his
reins and blown off his old shotgun. Still he would have let
oS both barrels, and would probably have loaded and shot
again, once he had tasted the sweetness of heroism. But one
shot, —and then silence?

I waited for some time for the second shot; nothing came,
and as I looked again at the sky there was no rain coming
either. So I went to bed, taking a book with me, and leaving
the lamp to burn. In Africa, when you pick up a book
worth reading, out of the deadly consignments which good
ships are being made to carry out all the way from Europe,
you read it as an author would like his book to be read,
praying to God that he may have it in him to go on as
beautifully as he has begun. Your mind runs, transported,
upon a fresh deep green track.

Two minutes later a motorcycle rounded the drive at a
terrific speed and stopped in front of the house, and some-
one knocked hard upon the long window of my sitting-
room. I put on a skirt and a coat and a pair of shoes, took
the lamp and went out. Outside was my mill-manager, wild-
eyed and sweating in the lamplight. His name was Belknap,
he was an American and an exceptionally capable, inspired
mechanic, but of an uneven mind. With him things were
either nearing the Millennium, or dark without a glimpse of
hope. When he first came into my employ he had upset me
by his varying views of life, and of prospects and condi-
tions of the farm, as if he had had me up in an enormous
mental swing; later I had got used to them. These ups and
downs were no more than a kind of emotional daily gym-
nastics to a lively temperament, much in need of exercise,
and to which too litde was happening; it is
90

phenomenon with energetic young white men in Africa,
particularly with those who have spent their early life in
towns. But here he came out of the hands of a tragedy, and
was as yet undecided as to whether he should satiate his
hungry soul by making the most of it, or escape from its
grimness by making as little of it as possible, and in this
dilemma he looked like a very young boy running for his
life to announce a catastrophe; he stuttered as he spoke. In
the end he made very little of it, for it held no part in it
for him to play, and fate had let him down once more.

By this time, Farah had come from his house, and listened
to his narrative with me.

Belknap told me how peacefully and pleasantly the trag-
edy had started. His Cook had had a day off, and in his
absence a party had been given in the kitchen by the seven
years old kitchen Toto, Kabero, a son of my old Squatter
and nearest neighbour on the farm, the old fox Kaninu. As,
late in the evening, the company became very gay, Kabero
had brought in his master’s gun and, to his wild friends of
the plains and shambas, had acted the part of a white man.
Belknap w^as a keen poultry farmer, he made capons and
poulardes and bought up pure-bred chicken at the Nairobi
sales, and he kept a shotgun on his verandah to frighten
away hawks and cerval-cats. When later we talked the case
over, Belknap held that the gun had not been loaded, but
that the children had looked up the cartridges and loaded it
themselves, but here I think that his memory failed him,
they could hardly have done it if they had wanted to, and it
was more likely that the gun had for once been left loaded
on the verandah. However it got there, the cartridge was in
the barrel when Kabero, in the greatness of youth and popu-
larity, aimed straight in amongst his guests and pulled the
trigger. The shot had boomed through the house. Three of

91

the children had been slightly wounded, and had fled from
the kitchen in terror. Two were there now, badly hurt or
dead. Belknap finished his tale by a long anathema of the
continent of Africa and of the things that happen there.

While he talked, my houseboys had come out, very silent;
they went in again, and brought out a hurricane-lamp. We
got out dressing and disinfectant. It would be a waste of
time to try to start the car, and we ran as quick as we could
through the forest down to Belknap’s house. The swinging
hurricane-lamp threw our shadows from the one side of the
narrow road to the other. As we ran on, we were met by
a succession of short raw cracked shrieks,— death squeals of
a child.

The kitchen door was flung back, as if Death, after hav-
ing rushed in, had rushed out again, and left the place in
dire devastation, a chicken-house that the badger has been
in. There was a kitchen lamp burning on the table and
smoking sky-high, and in the small room the smell of gun-
powder still hung. The gun was on the table beside the
lamp. There was blood all over the kitchen, I slipped in it
on the floor. Hurricane-lamps are difEcult to direct on to
any particular spot, but they give a very striking illumina-
tion of a whole room or situation; I remember the things I
have seen by the light of a hurricane-lamp better than
others.

I knew the children who had been shot, from the plains
of the farm, where they had herded their fathers’ sheep.
Wamai, Jogona’s son, a lively little boy who had for some
time been a pupil at the school, was lying on the floor be-
tween the door and the table. He was not dead, but not far
from death, and unconscious even, though he groaned a
little. We lifted him aside, to be able to move. The child
that shrieked was Wanyangerri, who had been the youngest
92



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

of the party in the kitchen. He was sitting up, leaning
forwards, towards the lamp; the blood spouted, like water
from a pump, from his face,— if one could still say that, for
he must have stood straight in front of the barrel when it
was fired and it had taken his lower jaw clean off. He held
his arms out from his sides and moved them up and down
like pump-spears, as the wings of a chicken go, after it has
had its head cut off.

When you are brought suddenly within the presence of
such disaster, there seems to be bat one advice, it is the
remedy of the shooting-field and the farmyard: that you
should kill quickly and at any cost. And yet you knov/ that
you cannot kill, and your brain turns with fear. I put my
hands to the child’s head and pressed it in my despair, and,
as if I had really killed him, he at the same moment stopped
screaming, and sat erect with his arms hanging down, as if
he was made of wood. So now’ I know what it feels like to
heal by imposition of hands.

It is a difficult thing to bandage a patient whose face is
half shot off, in your endeavour to stop the bleeding you
may choke him. I had to lift the little boy on to Farah’s
knee, and make Farah hold his head in position for me, for
if it fell forward I could not get the dressing fastened, and if
it fell back the blood ran down and filled his throat. In the
end, while he sat so still, I got the bandages placed.

We lifted Wamai on to the table and held the lamp up
to look at him. He had received the full charge of the gun
into his throat and chest, he did not bleed much, only a thin
trail of blood ran down from the corner of his mouth. It
was surprising to see this Native child, who had been as full
of life as a fawn, so quiet now. While we looked at him his
own face changed and took on an expression of deep sur-

93



OUT OF AFRICA

prise. I sent Farah to the house to fetch the car, for we had
no time to waste in bringing the children into hospital.

While we waited I inquired after Kabero, the boy who
had fired the gun and shed all this blood. Belknap then told
me a queer story about him. A couple of days earlier
Kabero had bought an old pair of shorts from his master,
and was to pay him with a rupee from his wages. When the
shot fell, and Belknap ran out to the kitchen, Kabero was
standing in the middle of the room with the smoking gun
in his hand. He stared at Belknap for a second, and then
dived into the pocket of the very shorts that he had so
newly bought and had put on for the party, drew up a
rupee and laid it on the table with his left hand, while with
his right he threw the gun also on the table. And in that
final settlement with the world he was gone; he actually,
although we did not know of it at the moment, in this great
gesture, disappeared from the face of the earth. It was an
unusual behaviour in a Native, for they generally manage
to keep a debt, and in particular a debt to a white man,
within the outskirts of their mind. Perhaps the moment to
Kabero had looked so much like the day of judgment, that
he felt he had got to play up to it; perhaps he was trying,
in the hour of need, to secure a friend. Or the shock, the
boom, and the death of his friends round him, had knocked
in the whole of the boy’s small sphere of ideas, so that bits
of the periphery had been flung into the very centre of his
consciousness.

At that time I had an old Overland car. I shall never write
anything against her, for she served me well through many
years. But it was rare that she could be induced to run on
more than two cylinders. Her lights were out of order too,
so that I used to drive in to dances at the Muthaiga Club
with a hurricane-lamp swaddled in a red silk handkerchief,

94



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

for a back light. She had to be pushed into starting, and
upon this night it took a long time.

Visitors to my house had been complaining of the state
of my road, and during the death-drive of that night I
realized that they had been right. I first let Farah drive, but
I thought that he was deliberately going into all the deep
holes and waggon-tracks of the road, and I took the steer-
ing-Avheel myself. For this I had to get off by the pond to
wash my hands in the dark water. The distance to Nairobi
seemed infinitely long, I thought that I might have driven
home to Denmark in the time that it took us.

The Native Hospital of Nairobi lies on the hill just before
you drive down into the cup of the town. It was dark now,
and seemed peaceful. We had much trouble to wake it up;
in the end we got hold of an old Goan doctor or doctor’s
assistant, who appeared in a queer sort of negligee. He was a
big fat man of a very placid manner, and had a strange way
of making the same gesture first with one hand and then
with the other. As I helped to lift Wamai out of the car I
thought that he stirred and stretched himself a little, but
when we brought him into the brightly lighted room in
the hospital, he was dead. The old Goan kept waving his
hand at him, saying: “He is dead.” And then again at
Wanyangerri, saying: “He is alive.” I never saw this old
man again, for I never came back to the hospital at night,
which was probably his hour there. At the time, I thought
his manner very annoying, but afterwards I felt as if Fate
itself in a number of big wHte cloaks, the one on the top of
the other, had met us at the threshold of the house, dealing
out Life and Death impartially.

Wanyangerri woke up from his trance when we took
him into the Hospital, and at once got into a terrible panic;
he would not be left but clung to me and to anybody neat

95

him and cried and wept in the greatest anguish. The old
Goan in the end calmed him by some injection, looked at
me over his spectacles and said: “He is alive.” I left the
children there, the dead and the live, upon two stretchers,
for their different fates.

Belknap, who had come in with us on his motor-bicycle,
mostly so as to help us to push the car into starting, should
she stop on the road, now thought that we ought to report
the accident to the PoKce. So we drove down into town to
the River Road Police Station, and thereby ran straight into
the night-life of Nairobi. There was no white Police Officer
present when we came, and while they sent for him we
waited outside in the car. The street had an avenue of tall
Eucalyptus trees, the tree of all pioneer-towns of the high-
lands; at night their very long narrow leaves give out a
queer pleasant smell, and look strange in the light of the
street-lamps. A big buxom young Swaheli woman was car-
ried into the Police Station by a group of Native Policemen,
she resisted with all her might, scratched their faces, and
screamed like a pig. A party of brawlers were brought in,
still eager, upon the steps of the Station, to go for one an-
other; and a thief, I believe, who had just been caught, came
down the street with a whole tail of night-revellers after
him, who were taking his part, or the part of the Police,
and were loudly debating the case. In the end a young Po-
lice Officer arrived, straight, I believe, from a gay party. He
was a disappointment to Belknap, for he began to take down
his report with the keenest interest and at a terrific speed,
but then fell into deep thoughts, dragged his pencil slowly
over the page and finally gave up writing and put his pencil
back into his pocket. I was cold in the night air. At last we
could drive home.

A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

While I was still in bed the next morning, I felt, by the
concentrated stillness outside the house, that there were
many people about it. I knew who they were: the old men
of the farm, squatting upon the stones, munching, sniffing
their tombacco, spitting, and wffiispering. I also knew what
they wanted: they had come to inform me that they wished
to set a Kyama on the case of the shot of last night, and of
the death of the children.

A Kyama is an assembly of the Elders of a farm, wffiich
is authorized by the Government to settle the local differ-
ences amongst the Squatters. The members of the Kyama
gather round a crime, or an accident, and will sit over it
for many weeks, battening upon mutton, talk, and disaster.
I knew that now the old men would w^ant to talk the whole
matter over with me, and also that they would, if they
could, in the end make me come into their court to give
the final judgment in the case. I did not want to take up an
endless discussion of the tragedy of the night, at this mo-
ment, and sent for my horse to get out and away from
them.

As I came out from the house I found, as I expected, the
whole circle of the Ancients to the left of it, near the boys’
huts. For the sake of their own dignity as an assembly they
pretended not to see me, until they realized that I w^as
going away. They then stumbled on to their old legs in
great haste, and began to flap their arms at me. I waved my
hand to them in return, and rode off.

I rode into the Masai Reserve. I had 'to cross the river to
get there; riding on, I got into the Game Reserve in a
quarter of an hour. It had taken me some time, while I
had lived on the farm, to find a place where I could get
over the river on horseback: the descent was stony, and
the slope up the other side very steep, but once in,— how

the delighted spirit pants for joy”.

Here lay before you a hundred miles’ gallop over grass
and open undulating land; there was not a fence nor a
ditch, and no road. There was no human habitation except
the Masai vfilages, and those were deserted half the year,
when the great wanderers took themselves and their herds
off to other pastures. There were low thorn trees regularly
spread over the plain, and long deep vaEeys with dry river-
beds of big flat stones, where you had to find a deer-path
here and there to take you across. After a little while you
became aware of how still it was out here. Now, looking
back on my life in Africa, I feel that it might altogether be
described as the existence of a person who had come from a
rushed and noisy world, into a still country.

A little before the rains, the Masai burn off the old dry
grass, and while the plains are thus lying black and waste



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARiU

they are unpleasant to travel on: you will get the black
charred dust, which the hoofs of your horse raise, all over
you and into your eyes, and the burnt grass-stalks are sharp
as glass; your dogs get their feet cut on them. But when the
rains come, and the young green grass is fresh on the plains,
you feel as if riding upon springs, and the horse gets a little
mad with the pleasantness. The various kinds of gazelles
come to the green places to graze, and there look like toy
animals stood upon a billiard table. You may ride into a
herd of Eland; the mighty peaceful beasts will let you get
close to them before they start trotting off, their long horns
streaming backwards over their raised necks, the large loose
flaps of breastskin, that make them look square, swaying as
they jog. They seem to have come out of an old Egyptian
epitaph, but there they have been ploughing the fields,
which gives them a familiar and domesticated air. The
Giraffe keep farther away in the Reserve.

At times, in the first month of the rains, a sort of wild
white fragrant Pink flowers so richly all over the Reserv^e
that at a distance the plains look patched with snow.

I turned to the animal w’orld from the world of men; my
heart was heavy with the tragedy of the night. The old
men sitting at my house made me uneasy; in old times peo-
ple must have had that feeling when they thought it likely
that a witch of the neighbourhood had fixed her mind upon
them, or was at the very moment carrying a wax-child
under her clothes, to be baptized with their own name.

My relations with the Natives in the legal affairs of the
farm were altogether of a queer nature. Since, before any-
thing, I wanted peace on the land, I could not keep out of
them, for a dispute between the Squatters, which has not
been solemnly settled, was like those sores that you get in
Africa, and which they there call veldt-sores: they heal on

99



OUT OF AFRICA


the surface if you let them, and go on festering and run-
ning underneath until you dig them up to the bottom and
have them cleaned all through. The Natives themselves were
aware of this, and if they really wanted a matter settled
they would ask me to give judgment.

As I knew nothing of their laws the figure that I cut at
these great courts of justice would often be that of a Prima
donna who does not remember a word of her part and has
to be prompted through it by the rest of the cast. This task
my old men took upon themselves with tact and patience.
It would also at times be the figure of an affronted Prima
donna who is shocked by her role and, refusing to go on
with it, walks off the stage. When this happened, my au-
dience took it as a hard blow from the hand of destiny, an
act of God outside their understanding; they looked on it
in silence and spat.

The ideas of justice of Europe and Africa are not the
same and those of the one world are unbearable to the other.
To the African there is but one way of counterbalancing
the catastrophes of existence, it shall be done by replace-
ment; he does not look for the motive of an action. Whether
you lie in wait for your enemy and cut his throat in the
dark; or you fell a tree, and a thoughtless stranger passes by
and is killed: so far as punishment goes, to the Native mind,
it is the same thing. A loss has been brought upon the com-
munity and must be made up for, somewhere, by some-
body. The Native will not give time or thought to the
weighing up of guilt or desert: either he fears that this may
lead him too far, or he reasons that such things are no con-
cern of his. But he will devote himself, in endless specula-
tions, to the method by which crime or disaster shall be
weighed up in sheep and goats,— time does not count to him;

he leads you solemnly into a sacred maze of sophistry. In
those days this went against my ideas of justice.

All Africans are the same in these rites. The Somali have
a very different mentality from the Kiku\m and a deep con-
tempt for them, but they will sit down in identical manner
to weigh up murder, rape, or fraud against their stock at
home in Somaliland,— dearly beloved she-camels, and horses,
the names and pedigree of which are written in their hearts.

Once the news came to Nairobi of how Farah’s little
brother, wdio rvas ten years old, in a place called Buramur,
had taken up a stone and thrown it at a boy of a different
tribe, knocking out tw^o of his teeth. Over this matter repre-
sentatives of the two tribes met at the farm to sit upon the
floor of Farah’s house and talk, night after night. Old lean
men came, who had been to Mekka and w’^ore a green turban,
arrogant young Somalis who, w^hen they were not attend-
ing to really serious matters, were gunbearers to the great
European travellers and hunters, and dark-eyed, round-faced
boys, w’ho wxre shyly representing their family and who did
not say a w^ord, but w^ere devoutly listening and learning.
Farah told me that the matter was considered so grave be-
cause the boy’s looks had been ruined, he might find it dif-
ficult, when his time came, to get married, and would have
to come dowm in his pretentions as to birth or beauty in his
bride. In the end the penance w^as fixed at fifty camels,
wdiich means half waregilt, full waregilr being one hundred
camels. Fifty camels were then bought, far away in Somali-
land, to be, ten years hence, laid on to the price of a Somali
maiden, and to turn her eyes off the two missing teeth of
her bridegroom; perhaps the foundation of a tragedy was
laid. Farah himself considered that he had got off lightly.

The Natives of the farm never realized my views on their


lOl



OUT OF AFRICA

legal systems, and they came to me first of all for their
indemnification when any ill-luck befell them.

Once, in the coffee-picking season, a young Kikuyu girl
named Wamboi was run over by a bullock cart outside my
house and killed. The carts were taking coffee from the
field to the mill, and I had forbidden anybody to go riding
on them. Otherwise I should have had at every trip a party
of gay coffee-picking girls and children taking a slow joy-
ride,— for anybody can walk quicker than a bullock,— all
across the farm, and it would be too heavy on my bullocks.
The young drivers, however, did not have it in them to send
away the dreamy-eyed girls who kept running alongside
their carts and begging for this great pleasure; all they could
do was to tell them to jump off where the road came into
sight of my house. But Wamboi fell as she jumped and the
wheel of the cart went over her small dark head and broke
the skull; a little blood trailed in the cart-track.

I sent for her old father and mother, who came in from
the picking-field and wailed over her. I knew that this
would also mean a heavy loss to them, for the girl had been
of marriage-age, and would have brought them in her price
of sheep and goats and a heifer or two. This they had been
looking forward to since her birth. I was considering how
much I ought to help them, when they forestalled me by
turning upon me, with great energy, their claim for a full
indemnification.

No, I said, I would not pay. I had told the girls of the
farm that I would not have them riding on the carts, all
people were aware of that. The old people nodded, there
was nothing here with which they did not agree, but they
stuck to their claim immovably. Their argument was that
somebody must pay. They could get no contradiction to
the principle into their heads, no more than they could
102



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

have got the theory of relativity in there. And it was not
greed or spite which, when I broke off the discussion and
went back, made them follow at my heels; it was, as if I
had been indeed magnetic, a law of Nature.

They sat down and waited outside my house. They were
poor people, small and underfed; they looked like a pair of
little badgers on my lawn. They sat there till the sun was
dowm and I could hardly distinguish them against the grass.
They were sunk in deep grief; their bereavement and their
economic loss melted into one overwhelming distress. Far ah
w^as away for the day; in his absence, at the time when the
lamps were lighted in my house, I sent them out money to
buy a sheep to eat. It was a bad move, they took it as the
first sign of exhaustion in a besieged Cicy and sat down for
the night. I do not know if they would have had it in them
to go aw^ay, if it had not been that, late in the evening, they
conceived the idea of running in the young cart-driver for
their damage. The idea lifted them off the grass and away,
suddenly, without a w^ord, and took them early next morn-
ing to Dagoretti, where our Assistant District Commissioner
lived.

It brought upon the farm a long murder-case and many
swaggering young Native Policemen. But all that the A.D.C.
offered to do for them was to have the driver hanged for
murder, and even that he gave up when he had got the
evidence in the case, and the Ancients would not hold a
Kyama upon the matter after both he and I had turned it
away. So in the end the old people had to sit down under a
law of relativity of which they did not understand a word,
as other people have had to do.

At times I grew tired of my Ancients of the Kyama and
told them what I thought of them.— “You old men,” I said,
“are fining the young men in order that it shall be impos-

103



OUT OF AFRICA

sible to them to collect any money for themselves. The
young men cannot move for you, and then you buy up all
the girls yourselves.” The old men listened attentively, the
small black eyes in their dry and wrinkled faces glittered,
their thin lips moved gently as if they were repeating my
words: they were pleased to hear, for once, an excellent
principle put into speech.

With all our diversities of views, my position as a judge
to the Kikuyu held a profusion of potentialities, and was
dear to me. I was young then, and had meditated upon the
ideas of justice and injustice, but mostly from the angle of
the person who is being judged; in a judge’s seat I had not
been. I took great trouble to judge rightly, and for peace on
the farm. At times, when the problems became difficult, I
had to retire and take time to think them over, covering my
head with a mental cloak so that nobody should come and
talk to me about them. This was always an effective move
with the people of the farm, and I heard them, a long time
afterwards, talk with respect of the case that had been so
deep that no one could look through it in less than a week.
One can always impress a Native by wasting more time
over a matter than he does himself, only it is a difficult
thing to accomplish.

But that the Natives should want me for a judge, and
that they should consider my verdict of value to them, of
this the explanation is found in their mythological or theo-
logical mentality. The Europeans have lost the faculty for
building up myths or dogma, and for what we want of
these we are dependent upon the supplies of our past. But
the mind of the African moves naturally and easily upon
such deep and shadowy paths. This gift of theirs comes out
strongly in their relations with white people.

You find it already in the names which they deal out to
104



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

the Europeans with whom they come in contact, after a
very short acquaintance. You have got to know these names
if you are to send a runner with letters to a friend, or find
the way in a car to his house, for the Native world knows
him by no other name. I have had an unsociable neighbour,
who would never entertain a guest in his house, who was
named Sahane Alodja— One Cover. My Swedish friend Eric
Otter was Resase Aiodja,— One Cartridge,— which meant that
he did not need more than one single cartridge to kill, and
which was a fine name to be known by. There w^as a keen
automobilist of my acquaintance, who was called ‘^Half
man— half car”. When Natives name white men after ani-
mals,— the Fish, the Giraffe, the Fat Bull,— their minds run
upon the lines of the old fables, and these white men, I
believe, in their dark consciousness figure as both men and
beasts.

And there is magic in words: a person who has for many
years been known to all his surroundings by the name of
an animal in the end comes to feel familiar with and related
to the animal, he recognises himself in it. When he is back
in Europe it is strange to him to feel that no one ever con-
nects him with it.

Once, in the London Zoo, I saw again an old retired
Government Official, whom in Africa I had known as
Bwdna T embu—Mi. Elephant. He was standing, all by him-
self, before the Elephant-house, sunk in deep contemplation
of the Elephants. Perhaps he would go there often. His Na-
tive servants would have thought it in the order of things
that he should be there, but probably no one in all London,
except I who was there only for a few days, would have
quite understood him.

The Native mind works in strange ways, and is related
to the mind of by-gone people, who naturally imagined

105



OUT OF AFRICA

that Odin, so as to see through the whole world, gave away
one of his eyes; and who figured the God of love as a child,
ignorant of love. It is likely that the Kdkuyu of the farm
saw my greatness as a judge in the fact that I knew nothing
whatever of the laws according to which I judged.

Because of their gift for myths, the Natives can also do
things to you against which you cannot guard yourself and
from which you cannot escape. They can turn you into a
symbol. I was weU aware of the process, and for my own
use I had a word for it,— in my mind I called it that they
were brass-serpenting me. Europeans who have lived for a
long time with Natives, will understand what I mean, even
if the word is not quite correctly used according to the
Bible. I believe that in spite of all our activities in the land,
of the scientific and mechanical progress there, and of Pax
Britannica itself, this is the only practical use that the Na-
tives have ever had out of us.

They could not make use of all white men for the pur-
pose, and not of one man and another equally. They gave
us, within their world, precedence of rank according to our
utility to them as brass-serpents. Many of my friends,—
Denys Finch-Hatton, both Galbraith and Berkeley Cole,
Sir Northrup MacMillan,— ranked highly with the Natives
in this capacity.

Lord Delamere was a brass-serpent of the first magnitude.
I remember that I once travelled in the highlands at the
time when the great pest of hoppers came on to the land.
The grasshoppers had been there the year before, now their
small black offspring appeared, to eat what they had left,
and to leave not a leaf of grass where they had passed. To
the Natives this was a terrible blow, after what they had
gone through it was too much for them to bear. Their
hearts broke, they panted, or howled like dying dogs, they
io6



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

ran their heads against a wall in the air before them. I then
happened to tell them how I had driven through Delamere’s
farm and had seen the hoppers on it, all over the place, in
his paddocks and on his grazing land, and I added that Dela-
mere had been in great rage and despair about them. iVt
that same moment the listeners became quiet and almost at
ease. They asked me what Delamere had said of his mis-
fortune, and again asked me to repeat it, and then they said
no more.

I did not, as a brass-serpent, carry the weight of Lord
Delamere, still there were occasions when I came in useful
to the Natives.

During the war, w^hen the fate of the Carrier Corps lay
upon the whole Native world, the squatters of the farm
used to come and sit round my house. They did not speak,
not even amongst themselves, they turned their eyes upon
me and made me their brass-serpent. I could not very well
chase them away, seeing that they did no harm, and be-
sides, if I had done so they w^ould have gone and sat down
in some other place. It was a singularly hard thing to bear.
I was helped through with it by the fact that my brother’s
regiment was at that time sent on to the foremost trenches
at Vimy Ridge: I could turn my eyes upon him and make
him my brass-serpent.

The Kikuyu made me a chief-mourner, or woman of
sorrows, when a great distress befell us on the farm. It was
what would happen now over the shooting-accident. Be-
cause I grieved for the children, the people of the farm
found it in them to lay the matter aside, and let it rest there
for the time being. In regard to our misfortunes they looked
upon me as the congregation looks upon the priest who
empties the cup alone, but on their behalf.

There is this about witchcraft, that when it has once been

107



OUT OF AFRICA

practised on you, you will never completely rid yourself
of it. I thought it a painful, a very painful process to be
hung upon the pole, I wished that I could have escaped it.
Still, many years after, there will be occasions when you
find yourself thinking: '‘Am I to be treated in such a way?—
I, who have been a brass-serpent!”

As I was riding back to the farm, on crossing the river
and actually in the water, I met a party of Kaninu’s sons,
three young men and a boy. They carried spears and came
along quickly. When I stopped them and asked for news of
their brother Kabero they stood, the water half way to
their knees, with still set faces and downcast eyes; they
spoke lowly. Kabero, they said, had not come back, and
nothing had been heard of him since he had run away last
night. They were now certain that he was dead. He would
either have killed himself in his despair— since the idea of
suicide comes very natural to all Natives, and even to Na-
tive children,— or he had been lost in the bush and the wild
animals had eaten him. His brothers had been round looking
for him m all directions, they were now on their way out
into the Reserve to try to find him there.

When I came up the river-bank on my own land, I
turned and looked out over the plain; my land was higher
up than the land of the Reserve. There was no sign of life
anywhere on the plain, except that a long way out the Zebra
were grazing and galloping about. As the party of searchers
emerged from the bush on the other side of the river, they
went on quickly, walking one by one; their small group
looked like a short caterpillar rapidly winding its way along
on the grass. At times the sun glinted on their weapons.
They seemed fairly confident of their direction, but what
would it be? In their search for the lost child, their only
guide would be the vultures that are always hanging in the

sky above a dead body on the plain, and will give you the
exact spot of a lion-kill.

But this would be only a very small body, not much of a
feast for the gluttons of the air, there would not be many
of them to spot it, nor would they be staying on for a very
long time.

All this was sad to think of. I rode home.

I went to the Kyama followed by Farah. I always had
Farah with me in my dealings with the Kikuyu, for while
he showed but little sense where his own quarrels were
concerned, and like all Somalis would lose his head alto-
gether wherever his tribal feelings and feuds came in, about
other people’s differences he had wisdom and discretion.
He was, besides, my interpreter, for he spoke Swaheli very
well.

I knew before I arrived at the assembly that the chief ob-
ject of the proceeding would now be to shear Kaninu as
close as possible. He would see his sheep driven away to all
sides, some to indemnify the families of the dead and wounded
children, some to maintain the Kyama. From the beginning
this went against me. For Kaninu, I thought, had lost his son
just as the other fathers, and the fate of his child seemed to
me the most tragic of the lot. Wamai was dead and out of it,
and Wanyangerri was in Hospital, where people were look-
ing after him, but Kabero had been abandoned by all, and
nobody knew where his bones lay.

Now Kaninu lent himself exceptionally well to his role of
the ox, fattened for a feast. He was one of my biggest squat-
ters; on my squatter-list he is down for thirty-five head of
I lO

cattle, five wives and sixty goats. His village was close to
my wood, I therefore saw much of his children and his
goats, and continually had to run in his women for cutting
down my big trees. The Kikuyu know nothing of luxury,
the richest amongst them live as the poor, and if I went into
Kaninu’s hut I would find nothing there in the way of fur-
niture except perhaps a small wooden stool to sit on. But
there were a number of huts at Kaninu’s village, and a lively
swarming of old women, young people and children round
them. And a long row of cattle, about milking time at sun-
set, advanced towards the village across the plains, with their
blue shadows walking gently on the grass beside them. All
this gave to the old lean man in the leather mantle, with
the net of fine wrinkles in his dark shrewd face all filled up
with dirt, the orthodox halo of a Nabob of the farm.

I and Kaninu had had many heated arguments, I had in-
deed been threatening to turn him off the farm, all over a
particular traffic of his. Kaninu was on good terms with the
neighbouring Masai tribe, and had married four or five of
his daughters off to them. The Kikuyu themselves told me
how in the old times the Masai had thought it beneath them
to intermarry with Kikuyu. But in our days the strange dy-
ing nation, to delay its final disappearance has had to come
down in its pride, the Masai women have no children and
the prolific young Kikuyu girls are in demand with the
tribe. All Kaninu’s offspring were good-looking people, and
he had brought back a number of sleek romping young
heifers across the border of the Reserve in exchange for his
young daughters. More than one old Kikuyu pater familias
in this period became rich in the same way. The big Chief
of the Kikuyu, Kinanjui, had sent, I was told, more than
twenty of his daughters to the Masai, and had got over a
hundred head of cattle back from them.


1 1 1



OUT OF AFRICA


But a year ago, the Masai Reserve had been put into quar-
antine for foot-and-mouth disease, and no stock could be
taken out of it. Here was a grave dilemma in the existence
of Kaninu. For the Masai are wanderers, and change their
abode according to season, rain and grazing, and those cows
in their herds which lawfully belonged to Kaninu were
dragged all over the land and would at times be a hundred
miles away, where nobody knew what was happening to
them. The Masai are unscrupulous cattle-dealers with any-
one, and more so with the Kikuyu whom they despise. They
are fine warriors and are said to be great lovers. In their
hands the hearts of Kaninu’s daughters were turning like the
hearts of the Sabine women of old, and he could no longer
rely on them. Therefore the resourceful old Kikuyu took
to having his cattle shifted at night, when the District Com-
missioner and the Veterinary Department were supposed to
be asleep, over the water to my farm. This was real villain-
ous behaviour on his part, for the Quarantine regulations are
amongst those which the Natives understand, they think
highly of them. Had these cows been found on my land, the
farm itself would have been put into quarantine. I therefore
set out watchmen down by the river to catch Kaninu’s re-
tainers, and on moonlight nights there had been many great
dramatic ambuscades, and swift flights along the silver stream,
and the heifers, upon which the whole concern turned, stam-
peded and ran away in all directions.

Jogona, the father of the- child Wamai, who had been
killed, was, on the other hand, a poor man. He had but one
old wife, and all he owned in the world were three goats.
He was not likely to make more, for he was a very simple
person. I knew Jogona well. A year before the accident, and
the sitting of the Kyama, a terrible murder had taken place
on the farm. Two Indians who were leasing a mill from me

I 12



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

a little way higher up the river, and were grinding mealie
to the Kikuyu, had been killed in the night, their goods had
been stolen, and the murderers were never found. The mur-
der scared off all the Indian traders and storekeepers of the
district, as if they had been blown away by a storm; I had
had to arm Pooran Singh down at my own mill with an old
shotgun to make him stay on, and even at that it had taken
much persuasion. I myself had thought, the first nights after
the murder, that I heard footsteps round the house, so for a
week I had kept a night watchman there, and this man was
Jogona. He was very gentle, and would have been of no use
against murderers, but he was a friendly old man and pleas-
ant to talk with. He had the manners of a gay child, his
broad face wore an inspired and keen expression, and when-
ever he looked at me he laughed. He now seemed very
pleased to see me at the Kyama.

But the Koran itself, which I was studying in those days
says: “Thou shalt not bend the justice of the law for the
benefit of the Poor.”

Besides myself, at least one member of the assembly was
aware that its purpose was now the flaying of Kaninu: this
was Kaninu himself. The other old men sat around, infi-
nitely attentive, and with all their wits collected for the pro-
ceedings. Kaninu, on the ground, had drawn his big cloak
of goatskin over his head, from time to time he gave out
under it a whine or whimper, like that of a dog which is
exhausted by howling and is just keeping its misery alive.

The old men wanted to begin with the case of the wounded
child Wanyangerri, because it gave them endless opportu-
nity for palaver. What was the indemnification to be if
Wanyangerri were dead? If he were disfigured? If he had
lost the faculty of speech? Farah, on my behalf, told them
that I would not discuss this matter until I had been in Nai-

II3

robi and had seen the doctor of the hospital. They swallowed
their disappointment and got their arguments on the next
case ready.

It was up to the Kyama, I told them through Farah, to
get this case settled quickly, and they should not sit over it
for the rest of their lives. It was clear that it was not a
murder-case, but a bad accident.

The Kyama honoured my speech with their attention, but
as soon as it was finished they opposed it.

“Msabu, we know nothing,” they said. “But here we see
that you do not know enough either, and we understand
only a little of what you say to us. It was Kaninu’s son who
fired the shot. Otherwise how would he be the only one not
hurt by it? If you want to hear more about it Mauge here
will tell you. His son was there and had one of his ears shot
off.”

Mauge was one of the wealthiest squatters* a sort of rival
of the farm to Kaninu. He was a very stately man to look
at, and his w'-ords had weight, although he spoke very slowly
and from time to time had to stop and think. “Msabu,” he
said. “My son told me: the boys all held the gun the one
after the other and pointed it at Kabero. But he would not
explain to them how to shoot with it, no he would not ex-
plain it at all. In the end he took the gun back, and at the
same moment it shot, it wounded all the children and killed
Wamai, Jogona’s son. This is exactly how it happened.”

“I knew all that already,” I said, “and it is what is called
bad luck, and an accident. I might have fired the shot from
my house, or you, Mauge, from yours.”

This created a great stir in the Kyama. They all looked
at Mauge, who became very uneasy. Then they talked for
some time amongst themselves, very lowly, as in a whisper.
At last they took up the discussion again. “Msabu,” they
1 14



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

said, “this time we do not understand one word of what you
are saying. We can only believe that you are thinking of a
rifle, since you yourself shoot so well with a rifle, but not so
well with a shotgun. If it had been a rifle you would have
been quite right. But nobody could shoot with a shotgun
from your house, or from Mange’s house, down to the house
of Bwana Menanya, and kill people within the house.”

After a short pause I said: “Everybody now knows that
it was Kaninu’s son w^ho fired the gun. Kaninu will pay Jo-
gona a number of sheep to make up for the loss. But every-
body also knows that Kaninu’s son was not a bad child and
did not mean to kill Wamai, and that Kaninu will not pay as
many sheep as if that had been the case.”

Here an old man by the name of Awaru spoke. He was in
closer contact with civilization than the others, for he had
been seven years in jail.

“Msabu,” he said, ''you say that Kaninu’s son was not bad
and that therefore Kaninu will not pay out very many
sheep. But if his son had wanted to kill Wamai and had thus
been a very bad child, would that have been a good thing to
Kaninu? Would he have been so pleased about that, that he
would have paid many more sheep?”

“Awaru,” I said, “you know that Kaninu has lost his son.
You go to the school yourself, so you know that this boy
was clever at school. If he w’as as good in all other ways, it
is a very bad thing to Kaninu to lose him.”

There was a long pause, not a sound in the ring. At the
end of it Kaninu, as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten
pain or duty, gave out a long wail.

“Memsahib,” said Farah, “let these Kikuyu now name the
figure that they have in their hearts.” He spoke in Swaheli
to me, so that the assembly should understand him, and suc-
ceeded in making them ill at ease, for a figure is a concrete

115



OUT OF AFRICA

thing, which no Native likes to give out. Farah let his eyes
run all round the circle and in a haughty way suggested:
''‘One hundred.” A hundred sheep was a fantastic number,
which nobody would seriously have thought of. A silence
fell upon the Kyama. The old men felt themselves at the
mercy of Somali mockery, and chose to lie low under it. A
very old man whispered “Fifty” but the figure seemed to
carry no weight but to be blown aloft in the current of air
of Far ah’s joke.

After a moment Farah himself briskly said “Forty” in the
manner of the experienced cattle-trader, at home with fig-
ures and stock. The word set astir the latent ideas of the
meeting; they began to talk very lively amongst themselves.
They would now need time, and would meditate and cackle
much, but all the same a basis for negotiations had been laid.
When we were at home again Farah said to me confidently:
“I think that these old men will take forty sheep from Kaninu.”

Kaninu at the Kyama had one more ordeal to go through.
For old broad-bellied Kathegu, another big squatter of the
farm, father and grandfather to an enormous household, here
rose and proposed to go through the sheep and goats which
Kaninu was to hand over, indicating them individually one
by one. This was all contrary to the custom of any Kyama,
Jogona could never have invented the scheme, and I could
only believe it to be founded upon an agreement between
Kathegu and Jogona, for the benefit of Kathegu. I waited
a little to see what would come of it.

Kaninu, to begin with, seemed to give himself up to his
martyrdom, he ducked his head and puled, as if, for each
animal named, a tooth was being drawn out of him. But
when at last Kathegu, himself hesitating, designated a big
yellow goat without horns, Kaninu’s heart broke and his
strength gave out. He came forward^ out of his cloak, in one
1 16



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

mighty gesture. For one moment he roared like a bull at me,
a bellow for help, an awful de profundis, until he saw, in a
quick glance, that I was on his side, and that he was not to
lose the yellow goat. He then sat down without another
sound; only after a while he gave Kathegu a very deep sar-
castic glance.

After about a week of sitting and supernumerary sittings
of the Kyama, the indemnification was finally fixed at forty
sheep, to be paid by Kaninu to Jogona, but no individual
sheep were to be indicated in the transfer.

A fortnight later Farah, in the evening while I was din-
ing, gave me fresh news of the case.

Three old Kikuyu from Nyeri, he told me, had arrived at
the farm the day before. They had heard of the case in their
huts up at Nyeri, and had walked from there to appear on
the stage and to plead that Wamai was not the son of Jo-
gona but was their late brother’s son, and that therefore the
compensation for his death should lawfully fall to them.

I smiled at the impudence, and remarked to Farah that this
was just like the Kikuyu of Nyeri. No, said Farah thought-
fully, he believed that they were right. Jogona had indeed
come from Nyeri to the farm six years ago, and, from what
Farah had gathered, Wamai was not Jogona’s son, ‘‘and
never had been,” Farah said. It was, he went on, a great
stroke of luck to Jogona that he had, tvvo days before, been
handed over twenty-five of his forty sheep. Otherwise Ka-
ninu would have let them wander off to Nyeri so as to save
himself the pain, Farah said, of meeting them on the farm
now that they were no longer his. But Jogona would have
to look out still, for the Nyeri Kikuyu were not easy to
shake off. They had taken up their abode on the farm and
were threatening to bring the case before the D.C.

In this way I was prepared for the appearance, a few days



OUT OF AFRICA

later, before my house, of the Nyeri people, who belonged
to a low class of Kikuyu, and had all the look of three dirty
and shaggy old Hyenas that had slunk one hundred and
fifty miles upon Wamai’s blood-track. With them came Jo-
gona, in a state of great agitation and distress. The differ-
ence in the attitude of the parties probably arose from the
fact that the Nyeri Kikuyu had nothing to lose, while Jo-
gona had twenty-five sheep. The three strangers sat on the
stones with no more manifestation of life than three ticks
upon a sheep. I had no sympathy with their cause, for,
whatever the circumstances were, they had taken no interest
in the dead child while he had lived, and I was now sorry
for Jogona, who had behaved well at the Kyama, and had,
I believed, grieved over Wamai. Jogona, when I questioned
him, trembled and sighed so that it was impossible to under-
stand him, and we got no further on this occasion.

But two days later Jogona came back early in the morn-
ing, when I was at my typewriter, and asked me to write
down for him the account of his relations to the dead child
and its family. He wanted to take the report before the
D.C. at Dagoretti. Jogona’s very simple manner was impres-
sive because he felt so strongly about things, and was en-
tirely without self-consciousness. It was evident that he was
looking upon his present resolution as upon a great enter-
prise, which was not without danger; he went to it with
awe.

I wrote his statement down for him. It took a long time,
for it was a long report of events more than six years old,
and in themselves extremely complicated. Jogona, as he was
going through it, continually had to break off his tale to
think things over or to’ go back in it and reconstruct it. He
was, most of the time, holding his head with both hands, at
moments gravely slapping the crown of it as if to shake out
Ii8



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM


the facts. Once he went and leaned his face against the wall,
as the Kikuyu women do when they are giving birth to their
children.

I took a duplicate of the report. I have still got it.

It was extremely difBcult to follow, it gave a lot of com-
plicated circumstances and irrelevant details. It was not sur-
prising to me that Jogona had found it difScult to recollect,
it was more surprising that he should be able to recollect the
facts at all. It began:

“At the time xvhen Waweru Wamai, of Nyeri, was about
to die— 72 a-takLZ ktifa^ wished to die, they have it in Swaheli,
—he had two wives. The one wife had three daughters, after
Waweru’s death she married another man. The other wife,
Waweru had not yet paid for altogether, he still owed her
father two goats for her. This wife had overstrained herself
when she lifted a load of firew^ood and had had a miscar-
riage and nobody knew if she would bear any more chil-
dren. . .

It went on in this way, and dragged the reader into a
thick maze of Kikuyu conditions and relations:

“This wife had one small child by the name of Wamai. At
that same time he was sick, and the people believed that he
had got small-pox. Waw^eru was very fond of his wife and
of her child, and when he was dying he was very much
worried because he did not know w^hat would become of
her when he himself should be dead. He therefore sent for
his friend Jogona Kanyagga, who lived not far away. Jo-
gona Kanyagga owed Waweru, at this time, three shillings
for a pair of shoes. Waweru now suggested to him that they
should make an agreement. ...”

The agreement came to this that Jogona should take over
his dying friend’s wife and child, and pay to her father the
two goats that were still due to him from the sum of her

H9



OUT OF AFRICA

purchase price. From now the report became a list of ex-
penses, which Jogona had brought upon himself through the
adoption of the child Wamai. He had, he stated, purchased
an extraordinary good medicine for Wamai just after he
had taken him over, when he was sick. At some time he had
bought rice from the Indian duca for him, as he did not
thrive on maize. Upon one occasion he had had to pay five
Rupees to a white farmer of the neighbourhood, who said
that Wamai had chased one of his turkeys into a pond. This
last amount of hard cash, which he had probably had diffi-
culty in raising, had stamped itself upon the mind of Jo-
gona; he came back to it more than once. From Jogona’s
manner it appeared that he had, by this time, forgotten that
the child whom he had now lost had not been his own. He
was shaken by the arrival and the claim of the three Nyeri
people, in many ways. Very simple people seem to have a
talent for adopting children, and feeling towards them as if
they were their own; the facile hearts of the European peas-
ants do the same without effort.

When Jogona had at last come to the end of his tale, and
I had got it all down, I told him that I was now going to
read it to him. He turned away from me while I was read-
ing, as if to avoid all distractions.

But as I read out his own name, “And he sent for Jogona
Kanyagga, who was his friend and who lived not far away,”
he swiftly turned his face to me, and gave me a great fierce
flaming glance, so exuberant with laughter that it changed
the old man into a boy, into the very symbol of youth.
Again as I had finished the document and was reading out
his name, where it figured as a verification below his thumb-
mark, the vital direct glance was repeated, this time deep-
ened and calmed, with a new dignity.

Such a glance did Adam give the Lord when He formed
120



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM


him out of the dust, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life, and man became a living soul. I had created him and
shown him himself: Jogona Kanyagga of life everlasting.
When I handed him the paper, he took it reverently and
greedily, folded it up in a corner of his cloak and kept his
hand upon it. He could not afford to lose it, for his soul was
in it, and it was the proof of his existence. Here was some-
thing which Jogona Kanyagga had performed, and which
would preserve his name for ever: the flesh was made word
and dwxlt among us full of grace and truth.

The wmrld of the written word was opened to the Native
of Africa at the time when I lived out there. I had then, if I
wanted to, an opportunity of catching the past by its tail
and of living through a bit of our own history: the period
when the large plain population of Europe had in the same
way had the letter revealed to them. In Denmark it hap-
pened a good hundred years ago, and from what I have been
told by people who were very old when I was a child, I be-
lieve that the reaction in both cases has been nearly exactly
the same. Human beings can but rarely have shown such a
humble and ecstatic devotion to the principle of Art for
Art’s sake.

These communications from one young Native to another
were still generally composed by professional letter writers,
for, although some of the old people were carried away by
the spirit of the age, and a few very old Kikuyu attended
my school and patiently toiled through the ABC, most of
the elder generation withheld themselves distrustfully from
the phenomenon. Only a few of the Natives could read, and
my houseboys, and the squatters and labourers of the farm,,
therefore brought their letters to me to have them read out.
As I opened and studied one letter after another, I wmndered
at the insignificance of the contents. It was the common mis^


I2I

cake of a prejudiced civilized person. You might as well have
set to herborize the little olive branch that Noah’s dove
brought home. Whatever it looked like, it carried more
weight than all the ark with the animals in it; it contained
a new green world.

The Natives’ letters were all very much alike, they kept
close to a sanctioned and sacred formula, and ran more or
less as follows: “My dear friend Kamau Morefu. I will now
take the pen in my hand”— in an unliteral sense, for it was
the professional scribe who was writing, “to write you a
letter, for I have for a long time wished to write a letter to
you. I am very well and it is my hope that you are, by the
grace of God, very well. My mother is very well. My wife
is not very well, but I still have the hope that your wife
will be, by the mercy of God, well.”— here would follow a
long list of names, with a short report attached to each of
them, mostly insignificant, although at times very fantastic.
Then the letter was closed. “Now my friend Kamau, I will
finish this letter, for I have got too little time to write to
you. Your friend Ndwetti Lori.”

To transfer similar messages between young studious Euro-
peans a hundred years ago, Postillions vaulted into the sad-
dle, horses galloped. Post-horns were blown, and paper with
ligulate gilt edges was manufactured. The letters were wel-
comed, cherished, and preserved, I have seen a few of them
myself.

Before I learned to speak Swaheli, my relation to this Na-
tive world of letters had a curious feature to it: I could read
out what they wrote without understanding a word of it.
The Swaheli tongue has had no written language until the
white people took upon themselves to make up one; with
care it was spelled out as it is pronounced, and it has got no
antiquated orthography to entrap a reader. I would then sit
122



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

and read out their writings orthodoxly, word for word, with
the receivers of the letters in breathless suspense all around
me, and could follow the effect of my reading without in
the least knowing what it w^as all about. Sometimes they
would burst into tears at my words, or wring their hands, at
other times they cried out with delight; the most common
reaction to the lection w^as laughter, and they were continu-
ally doubled up by convulsions of laughter while I read.

When later on I got so far as to understand what I was
reading, I learned that the effect of a piece of news was
many times magnified when it was imparted in writing. The
messages that would have been received with doubt and
scorn if they had been given by word of mouth,— for all
Natives are great Sceptics,— were now taken as gospel truth.
Natives are, in the same way, extremely quick of hearing
towards any confounding of a wwd in speech; such a mis-
take gives them a great malicious pleasure, and they will
never forget it, and may name a white-man for his lifetime
after a slip of his tongue; but if a mistake was made in writ-
ing, which was often the case, as the Scribes were ignorant
people, they would insist on construing it into some sense,
they might wonder over it and discuss it, but they would
believe the most absurd things rather than find fault with
the written wmrd.

In one of the letters that I read out to a boy on the farm,
the writer, amongst other news, gave the laconic message:
“I have cooked a baboon.” I explained that he must have
meant that he had caught a baboon, since also in Swaheli the
two words are somewhat alike. But the receiver of the letter
would by no means consent to it.

‘‘No, Msabu, no,” he said, “what has he written in my let-
ter? what is written down?”

“He has written,” I said, “that he has cooked a baboon,

123



OUT OF AFRICA


6ut how would he cook a baboon? And if he had really-
done so he would write more to tell you of why and how
he did it.”

The young Kikuyu grew very ill at ease at such criticism
of the scriptural word, he asked to have his letter back,
folded it up carefully and walked away with it.

As to Jogona’s statement which I took down, it proved
very useful to him, for when the D.C. had read it, he dis-
missed the appeal of the Nyeri people, who walked scowling
back to their own village, without having got anything off
the farm.

The document now became Jogona’s great treasure. I saw
it again more than once. Jogona made a little leather bag fo{
it, embroidered with beads, and hung it on a strap round
his neck. From time to time, mostly on Sunday mornings,
he would suddenly appear in my door, lift the bag off and
take out the paper to have it read to him. Once when I had
been ill, and was for the first time again out riding, he caught
sight of me at a distance, ran after me a long way, and stood
by my horse all out of breath, to hand me his document. At
each reading his face took on the same impress of deep reli-
gious triumph, and after the reading he solicitously smoothed
out his paper, folded it up and put it back in the bag. The
importance of the account was not lessened but augmented
with time, as if to Jogona the greatest wonder about it was
that it did not change. The past, that had been so difficult to
bring to memory, and that had probably seemed to be chang-
ing every time it was thought of, had here been caught, con-
quered and pinned down before his eyes. It had become His-
tory; with it there was now no variableness neither shadow
of turning.

When I was next in Nairobi, I went to see Wanyangerri in
the Native Hospital.

As I had so many squatter families on my land, I was
hardly ever without a patient in there, I was an habituee de
la maison, and on friendly terms with the matron and the
orderlies. I have never seen a person who put on paint and
powder so thick as the Matron, within her white coiffe her
broad face looked like the face of those Russian wooden
dolls which will unscrew, and have then got another doll in-
side them, and another inside that, and which are sold under
the name of Katinka. She was a kind and capable matron, as
you would expect it from Katinka. On Thursdays they
moved all beds out of the wards to an open square be-
tween them, while they cleaned and aired the houses. This
was a pleasant day in hospital. There was a great fine view
from the court, with the dry Athi plains in the foreground,
and far away the blue mountain of Donyo Sabouk and the
long Mua Hills. It was a curious thing to see my old Ki-
kuyu women in beds with white sheets to them, like seeing
an old worn-out mule, or other patient beast of burden,
there; they themselves laughed to me at the situation, but
sourly, as an old mule might do, for Natives are afraid of
hospitals.


125



OUT OF AFRICA

The first time that I saw Wanyangerri in hospital, he was
so shaken and overcome that I thought the best thing for
him would be to die. He was frightened of everything,
weeping all the time that I was with him, and begging to be
taken back to the farm; he shook and trembled in his band-
ages.

It was a week till I came in again. I found him then calm
and collected, he received me with dignity. He was how-
ever very pleased to see me, and the orderly told me that
he had been waiting impatiently for my arrival. For he
could to-day tell me, with much assertiveness, and spitting
out the words through a tube in his mouth, that he had been
killed the day before, and was going to be killed again in a
few days’ time.

The doctor who treated Wanyangerri had been to the
war in France, and had patched up many people’s faces, he
took trouble about him and made a success of the work. He
put in a metal band for a jawbone and screwed it on to the
bones left in the face, and he plucked up the bits of torn
flesh and stitched them together to make a sort of chin for
him. He even, Wanyangerri told me, had a bit of skin taken
from the shoulder to fill up his patchwork. When at the end
of the treatment the bandages came off, the face of the child
was much changed, and looked queer, like the head of a
lizard, because it had got no chin. But he was able to eat in
a normal way and to speak, although after the accident he
always lisped a little. All this took many months. When I
came to see Wanyangerri he asked me for sugar, so I used
to bring a few spoonfuls in a bit of paper.

The Natives, if they are not paralyzed and benumbed by
their terror of the unknown, growl and grumble much in
hospital, and invent schemes for getting away. Death is one
120



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

of these; they do not fear it. The Europeans who have built
and equipped the hospitals, and who are working in them,
and have with much trouble got the patients dragged there,
complain with bitterness that the Natives know nothing of
gratitude, and that it is the same what you do to them.

To white people there is something vexatious and morth
fying in this state of mind in the Natives. It is indeed the
same what you do to them; you can do but little, and what
you do disappears, and wdll never be heard of again; they do
not thank you, and they bear you no malice, and even
should you want to, you cannot do anything about it. It is
an alarming quality; it seems to annul your existence as an
individual human being, and to inflict upon you a role not
of your own choosing, as if you were a phenomenon in Na-
ture, as if you were the weather.

The immigrant Somalis in this respect differ from the Na-
tives of the country. Your behaviour to them affects them
strongly, in fact, you can hardly move without affecting the
fierce burning prigs of the desert in one w^ay or the other,
and, very often, not without deeply hurting them. They
have a keen sense of gratitude and will also bear malice for
ever. A benefit, like an offence or a slight, is written in stone
in their hearts. They are severe Mohammedans and, like all
Mohammedans, have a moral code according to which they
will judge you. With the Somalis you can make or destroy
your prestige within an hour.

The Masai here hold a position peculiar to themselves
amongst the Native tribes. They remember, they can thank
you, and they will bear you a grudge. They all bear us all a
grudge, which will be wiped out only when the tribe is
wiped out itself.

But the unprejudiced Kikuyu, Wakambas, or Kavirondos,
know of no code. They have it that most people are capable

127



OVT OF AFRICA

of most things, and you cannot shock them if you want to.
It is, it can be said, a poor or perverted Kikuyu, to whom
it makes any difference what you do to him. Left to their
own nature, and to the tradition of their nation, they will
look upon our activities as upon those of nature. They judge
you not, but they are keen observers. The sum of their ob-
servations is what you pass for with them, your good or bad
name.

The very poor people of Europe, in this way, are like the
Kikuyus. They judge you not, but sum you up. If they like
or esteem you at all, it is in the manner in which people love
God; not for what you do to them, not at all for what you
do to them, but for what you are.

One day in my wanderings through the hospital I saw
three new patients there, a very black man with a thick
heavy head, and two boys, who were all three bandaged at
the throat. One of the orderlies in the ward was a hunch-
back and a narrator, who took a pleasure in explaining to me
the most intriguing cases in his house. As he saw me stop-
ping before the beds of the newcomers he came up and told
me their story.

They were Nubians in the band of the King’s African
Rifles, the black soldiers of Kenya. The boys were drum-
mers, and the man a horn-player. The horn-player had had
serious controversies in his life, and had lost his head over
them as it will happen to Natives. First he had fired his rifle
right and left over the barracks, and when the magazine was
empty he had shut himself up with the two boys, in his hut
of corrugated iron there, and had tried to cut their throats
and his own. The orderly was sorry that I had not seen them
when they had been brought in last week, for then they had
all been covered in blood, and I would have believed them
128



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

to be dead. Now they were out of danger, and the murderer
had got his senses back.

As the story-teller went through his tale, the three persons
in the bed upon whom it turned, were following it with
deep attention. They interrupted him to correct the details
of his tale, the boys, who had great difficulty in speaking,
turning to the man in the bed between them to make him
confirm their statement, confident that he would assist them
to let me have the story as effectively as possible.

‘‘Did you not foam at the mouth, did you not shriek?*'
they asked him. “Did you not say that you would cut us up
in bits as big as a grasshopper?”

The manslayer said “Yes, yes,” with a mournful mien.

At times I would be kept in Nairobi for half a day, wait-
ing for a business-meeting, or for the European mail when
the train from the coast was late. On such occasions when
I did not know what to do, I used to drive up to the Native
Hospital and take a couple of the convalescents there out
for a short joy-ride. At the time when Wanyangerri was in
hospital, the Governor, Sir Edward Northey, kept a couple
of young lions, which he was sending on to the London Zoo,
caged up in the Government House grounds. They were a
great attraction to the people in hospital; they all asked to
be taken to see them. I had promised the patients of the
K.xA^.R. band to take them up there when they were well
enough for it, but none of them would come until they
could all go together. The horn-player was the slowest to
recover, one of the boys was even discharged from hospital
before he was well enough to go with me. The boy came
back to hospital every day to inquire about him, so as to be
sure to have his drive. I found him outside there one after-
noon, and he told me that the bugler still had a very terrible

129



OUT OF AFRICA

headache, but that this was only to be expected since his
head had been so filled with devils.

In the end they came, all three, and stood before- the cage
sunk in contemplation. One of the young lions, angry at be-
ing stared at for such a long time, suddenly got up, stretched
himself and gave a short roar, so that the onlookers got a
shock, and the smallest boy took cover behind the bugler.
As we were driving back he said to him: “That lion was as
villainous as you were.”

During all this time Wanyangerri’s case was lying dor-
mant out on the farm. His people sometimes came and asked
me how he was getting on, but, with the exception of his
little brother, they seemed scared of going in to see him.
Kaninu also came round to my house late in the evening,
like an old badger out reconnoitring, to sound me about the
child. Farah and I, between ourselves, at times weighed up
his sufferings, and computed them in sheep.

Farah also, a couple of months after the accident, in-
formed me of a new feature of the case.

On these occasions he would come in while I was dining,
stand erect by the end of the table and take upon himself to
enlighten my ignorance. Farah spoke both English and
French well, but stuck to certain mistakes peculiar to him.
He would say “exactly” in the place of “except”,— “all the
cows have come home, exactly the grey cow”,— and instead
of correcting him I took to using the same expressions when
I talked to him. His face and countenance were assured and
dignified, but he would often start in a vague manner: “Mem-
sahtb,” he said, “the Kabero.” This was the programme then.
I waited for what was to follow.

After a pause Farah took up the subject again. “You think,
130



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

Memsahib,” he said, “that Kabero is dead and has been eaten
by the hyenas. He is not dead. He is with the Masai.’'

In two minds I asked him how he knew of this. “Oh, I
know,” he said, “Kaninu has got too many girls married to
Masai. When Kabero could not think of anybody who
would help him exactly the Masai, he ran out to his sister’s
husband. It is true that he had a bad time, he sat all night in
a tree and the Hyenas stood around it underneath. Now he
is living with the Masai. There is a rich old Masai, who has
got many hundred cows, who has no children himself and
wants to get Kabero. Kaninu knows of all this very well,
and has been out to talk it over with the Masai many times.
But he is afraid to tell you, he believes that if the white peo-
ple know of it, Kabero will be hanged in Nairobi.”

Farah always spoke of the Kikuyu in an arrogant way.
“The Masai wdves,” he said, “bear no children. They are
pleased enough to get Kikuyu children. They steal too
many. Still, this Kabero,” he went on, “he will come back
to the farm when he grows up, for he will not want to
live like the Masai, always going from one place to the
other. The Kikuyu are too lazy for that,”

From the farm, the tragic fate of the disappearing Masai
tribe on the other side of the river could be followed from
year to year. They were fighters who had been stopped fight-
ing, a dying lion wdth his claws clipped, a castrated nation.
Their spears had been taken from them, their big dashing
shields even, and in the Game Reserve the lions followed their
herds of cattle. Once, on the farm, I had three young bulls
transmuted into peaceful bullocks for my ploughs and wag-
gons, and afterwards shut up in the factory yard. There in
the night the Hyenas smelled the blood and came up and
killed them. This, I thought, was the fate of the Masai.



OUT OF AFRICA


‘^Caninu’s wife,” said Farah, “is sorry to lose her son for
so many years.”

I did not send for Kaninu, for I did not know whether to
believe what Farah had told me or not, but when he next
came to my house I went out to talk with him. “Kaninu,” I
asked him, “is Kabero alive? Is he with the Masai?” You will
never find a Native unprepared for any action of yours, and
Kaninu immediately burst into weeping over his lost child.
I listened to him and looked at him for a little while. “Ka-
ninu,” I said again, “bring Kabero here. He will not be
hanged. His mother shall keep him with her on the farm.”
Kaninu had not stopped his laments to listen, but he must
have caught my unfortunate word of hanging; his wails
were drawn into a deeper note, he dived into descriptions
of the promise that Kabero had given, and of his own pref-
erence for him above all his other children.

Kaninu had a lot of children and grandchildren who, as
his village was so near to my house, were always about it.
Amongst them was a very small grandson of his, the son of
one of those daughters of Kaninu who had married into the
Masai Reserve, but who had come back from it and had
brought her child with her. This child’s name was Sirunga.
The mixture of blood in him had come out in the quaintest
vitality, such a wild profusion of inventiveness and whims
that he was like nothing quite human: a small flame, a night-
bird, a diminutive genie of the farm. But he had epilepsy,
and, because of that, the other children were afraid of him,
chasing him away from their games and naming him She-
itafiij— the devil,— so that I had adopted him into my house-
hold. As he was ill he could do no work, but he filled with
me exceedingly well the office of a fool or jester and followed
me about everywhere like a small fidgety black shadow.
Kaninu knew of my affection for the child, and till now had

132



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

smiled at it in a grandfatherly way; now he seized it, turned
it at me and worked it for all it was worth. He declared
with great strength that he would rather have Sirunga ten
times eaten bv leopards than he would lose Kabero, indeed
now that Kabero was lost let Sirunga go as well, it would
make no difference,— for Kabero, Kabero had been the ap--
pie of his eye and his heart’s blood.

If Kabero were indeed dead, this was David grieving over
his son x\bsalom, a tra^edv to be left to itself. But if he were
alive and hidden with the Masai it was more than tragic, it
was a fight or flight, a struggle for the life of a child.

I have seen, on the plains, the gazelles play this game when
I have unknowingly come upon the spot where they were
hiding their new’born fawn. They would dance to you, step
up before you, jump, caper or pretend to be lame and un-
able to run,— all to distract your attention from their young.
And suddenly, actually under the hoofs of your horse, you
saw the fawn, immovable, the small head stretched out flat
on the grass, lying low for his life while his mother dances
for it. A bird will do the same tricks to protect her young
ones, flap and flutter and even cleverly act the role of the
wounded bird, which trails her broken wing on the ground.

Here was Kaninu performing to me. Was there so much
warmth and so many gambols left in the old Kikuyu when
he thought his son’s life at stake? His bones creaked in the
dance, he was even changing sex in it, and had taken on the
appearance of an old woman, a hen, a lioness,— the game was
so plainly a feminine activity. It was a grotesque performance,
but at the same time highly respectable, like the cock ostrich
taking turns with the hen in sitting on her eggs. No w^oman’s
heart could have remained unmoved by the manoeuvre.

‘"Kaninu,” I said to him, “when Kabero wants to return to
the farm he can do so and no harm shall come to him. But


133



OUT OF AFRICA

you must bring him up here to me yourself at that time.”
Kaninu became dead silent, he bowed his head and walked
away sadly as if he had now lost his last friend in the world.

I may as well tell here that Kaninu remembered, and did
as he had been told. Five years afterwards, when I had al-
most forgotten the whole affair, he one day through Farah
applied for an interview. I found him standing outside the
house, on one leg, very dignified, but at the bottom of his
heart uneasy. He addressed me in an amiable way. “Kabero
is back,” he said. By that time I had learned the art of the
pause, I did not say a word. The old Kikuyu felt the weight
of my silence, he changed feet, and his eyelids quivered.
“My son Kabero has come back to the farm,” he repeated.
I asked: “He is back from Masai?” Immediately, by the fact
that he had made me speak, Kaninu took it that our recon-
ciliation was effected; he did not smile yet, but all the cun-
ning little wrinkles in his face were adjusted for a smile.
“Yes, Msabu, yes, he is back from the Masai,” he said, “he
has come back to work for you.” The Government in the
intermediate time had introduced the Kipanda, the registra-
tion of each individual Native, in the country, so that we
would now have to call a Police OfEcer out from Nairobi to
make a lawful inhabitant of the farm out of Kabero. Kaninu
and I appointed the day.

Upon that day, Kaninu and his son arrived a long time
before the Police Officer. Kaninu presented Kabero to me in
a jovial manner, but at heart he was a little frightened of his
recovered son. He had reason to be so, for the Masai Re-
serve had had from the farm a small lamb, and now gave us
back a young leopard. Kabero must have had Masai blood in
him, the habits and discipline of Masai life could not in

134



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM
themselves have worked the metamorphosis. Here he stood,
a Masai from head to foot.

A Masai warrior is a fine sight. Those young men have,
to the utmost extent, that particular form of intelligence
which we call daring, and wildly fantastical as they

seem, they are still unswervingly true to their own nature,
and to an immanent ideal. Their style is not an assumed
manner, nor an imitation of a foreign perfection; it has
grown from the inside, and is an expression of the race and
its history, and their weapons and finery are as much part
of their being as are a stag’s antlers.

Kabero had adopted the Masai fashion in hair- dressing, he
wore his hair long and braided with string into a thick pig-
tail and a leather strap round the brow. He had acquired
the Masai carriage of the head, with the chin stretched for-
ward, as if he were presenting you his sullen arrogant face
upon a tray. He had also the general rigid, passive, and in-
solent bearing of the Moran, that makes of him an object for
contemplation, such as a statue is, a figure which is to be

seen, but which itself does not see.

The young Masai Morani live upon milk and blood; it is
perhaps this diet that gives them their wonderful smoothness
and silkiness of skin. Their faces, with the high cheek-bones
and boldly swung jaw-bones, are sleek, without a line or
groove in them, swollen; the dim unseeing eyes lie therein
like two dark stones tightly fitted into a mosaic; altogether
the young Morani have a likeness to mosaics. The muscles
of their necks swell in a particular sinister fashion, like the
neck of the angry cobra, the male leopard or the fighting
bull, and the thickness is so plainly an indication of virility
that it stands for a declaration of war to all the world with
‘ the exception of the woman. The great contrast, or har-
mony, between these swollen smooth faces, full necks and

135



OUT OF AFRICA

broad rounded shoulders, and the surprising narrowness of
their waist and hips, the leanness and spareness of the thigh
and knee and the long, straight, sinewy leg give them the
look of creatures trained through hard discipline to the
height of rapaciousness, greed, and gluttony.

The Masai walk stiffly, placing one slim foot straight in
front of the other, but their movements of arm, wrist and
hand are very supple. When a young Masai shoots with a
bow and arrow, and lets go the bow-string, you seem to
hear the sinews of his long wrist singing in the air with the
arrow.

The Police Officer from Nairobi was a young man lately
out from England and full of zeal. He spoke Swaheli very
well, so that I and Kaninu did not understand what he said,
and he became absorbed in interest in the old case of the
shooting accident, and put Kaninu to a cross-examination
under which the Kikuyu turned into wood. When he had
finished it, he told me that he thought Kaninu had been
monstrously treated, and that the whole case ought to be
taken up in Nairobi. “That will mean years of your life and
mine,” I said. He asked me to be allowed to remark that this
was no consideration to be taken, where the execution of
justice was concerned. Kaninu looked to me, for a moment
he believed that he was being trapped. In the end it was
found that the case was too old to be taken up, and nothing
more was done about it, except that Kabero was regularly
registered on the farm.

But all these things were to happen only a long time later.
For five years Kabero was dead to the farm, wandering with
the Masai, and Kaninu had much to go through still. Before
the case had done with him, forces came into play which
seized him and ground him very small.

136



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

Of those I cannot tell much. First because they were in
themselves of a hidden nature, and secondly, because at the
time things were happening to me myself, that took my
thoughts off Kaninu and his fate, and left, in my mind, the
general affairs of the farm in the background like that dis-
tant mountain of Kilimanjaro, which sometimes I could see
from m.y land, and sometimes not. The Natives w^ould take
such periods of distraction of mine meekly, as if I had been
in reality lifted from their existence into another plane, af-
terwards they referred to them as to times when I had been
away. ''That big tree fell down,” they said- ^‘My child died,
while you were with the Avhite people.”

When Wany anger ri was w^eli enough to leave Hospital, I
fetched him back to the farm, and from that time only saw
him at intervals, at an Ngoma or on the plains.

A few days after his return his father, Wainaina, and his
grandmother presented themselves at my house. Wainaina
was a small rotund man, a rare thing in a Kikuyu, for they
are nearly all of them lean people. He grew a spare thin
beard, and another peculiarity of his was that he could not
look you straight in the face. He made the impression of a
mental troglodyte, who wants to be left to himself. With
him came his mother, a very old Kikuyu w- oman.

Native women shave their heads, and it is a curious thing
how quickly you yourself will come to feel that these little
. round neat skulls, which look like some kind of dusky nuts,
are the sign of true womanliness, and that a crop of hair on
the head of a woman is as unladylike as a beard. Wainaina’s
old mother had left the little tufts of wTite hair on her
shrivelled scalp to grow, and thereby, as much as an un-
shaven man, she conveyed the impression of dissoluteness or
shamelessness. She leant on her stick and left it to Wainaina
to speak, but her silence was striking sparks the while; she

137



OUT OF AFRICA

seemed to be all loaded with a graceless vitality, of which
she had passed none on to her son. The two were in reality
Uraka and Laskaro, but of that I did not know till later.

They had come shuffling up to my house on a peaceful
errand. Wanyangerri, his father told me, could chew no
maize, they were poor people and short of flour and they
had got no milking cow. Would I not, till Wany anger ri’s
case was settled, allow him a little milk from my cows?
Otherwise they did not see how they were to keep the child
alive until the time when his indemnification should come in.
Farah was away in Nairobi on one of his private Somali law-
suits, and in his absence I consented to let Wanyangerri have a
bottle of milk a day from my herd of Native cows, and in-
structed my houseboys, who seemed strangely unwilling or
uncomfortable about the arrangement, to let him fetch it
from us every morning.

A fortnight passed, or three weeks, then one evening Ka-
ninu came to the house. He suddenly stood in the room
where I was reading by the fire after dinner. As the Natives
generally prefer a discussion to take place outside the house,
the manner in which he shut the door behind him, prepared
me for surprising communications. But the first surprise was
that Kaninu was dumb. The subtle and honeyed tongue was
as dead as if it had been cut out of him, and the room, with
Kaninu in it, remained silent. The big old Kikuyu was look-
ing very ill, he hung upon his stick, there seemed to be no
body inside his cloak, his eyes were dim like the eyes of a
corpse, and he kept on wetting his dry lips with his tongue.

When at last he began to speak it was only to state, slowly
and dismally, that he thought things were bad. A little later
he added in a vague manner, as if it were altogether a matter
to be ignored, that he had now paid over ten sheep to Wai-
naina. And now Wainaina, he went on, wanted a cow and
138



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

calf from him as well, and he was going to give them to him.
Why had he done that, I asked him, when no judgment had
yet been given? Kaninu did not answer, he did not even
look at me. He was, this evening, a traveller or pilgrim who
had no continuing city. He had come in, as it were on his
way, to report to me, and now he was off again. I could not
but think that he was ill, after a pause I said that I would
take him into hospital the next day. At that he gave me a
short, painful glance: the old mocker was being bitterly
mocked. But before he went away he did a curious thing,
he lifted up a hand to his face as if he were wiping off a
tear. It would be a strange thing, like the flowering of the
pilgrim’s staff, should Kaninu have tears in him to shed, and
stranger still that he should put them to no use. I wondered
what had been happening on the farm while I had had my
thoughts off it. When Kaninu had gone I sent for Farah and
asked him.

Farah at times was loth to speak about Native affairs, as
if they were beneath him to dwell upon and me to hear of.
In the end he consented to tell me, all the time looking past
me out of the window, at the stars. At the bottom of Ka-
ninu’s loss of heart was Wainaina’s mother, who was a witch
and had cast a spell upon him.

“But, Farah,” I said, “Kaninu, surely, is much too old and
wise to believe in a spell.”

“No,” said Farah slowly. “No, Memsahib. For this old
Kikuyu wife can really do these things, I think.”

Xhe old woman had told Kaninu that his cows would live
to see that it would have been better to them had Kaninu at
the beginning given them to Wainaina. Now Kaninu s cows
were going blind, one after another. And under the ordeal
Kaninu’s heart was slowly breaking, like the bones and tis-

139



OUT OF AFRICA

sue of those people who, in old times, were put to the tor-
ture of ever increased weights laid on to them.

Farah spoke of Kikuyu witchcraft in a dry, concerned
manner, as of foot-and-mouth disease on the farm, which
we ourselves would not catch, but by which we might lose
our cattle.

I sat late in the evening thinking of the witchery on the
farm. At first it looked ugly, as if it had come up from an
old grave to flatten its nose upon my window-panes. I heard
the Hyena wailing some way off, down by the river, and
remembered that the Kikuyu had their were-wolves, old
women who at night take on the shape of Hyenas. Perhaps
Wainaina’s mother was trotting along the river now, baring
her teeth in the night-air. And I had by now become used
to the idea of witchcraft, it seemed a reasonable thing, so
many things are about, at night, in Africa.

“This old woman is mean,” I thought in Swaheli, “she uses
her arts in making Kaninu’s cows blind, and she leaves it to
me to keep her grandchild alive, on a bottle of milk a day,
from my own cows.”

I thought: “This accident and the things which have come
from it, are getting into the blood of the farm, and it is my
fault. I must call in fresh forces, or the farm will run into a
bad dream, a nightmare. I know what I will do, I will send
for Kinanjui.”


140



The big Chief Kinanjui lived about nine miles North-
East of the farm, in the Kikuyu Reserve near the French
Mission, and ruled over more than a hundred thousand
Kikuyus. He was a crafty old man, with a fine manner,
and much real greatness to him, although he had not been
born to be a Chief, but had been made so, many years ago,
by the English, when they could no longer get on with the
legitimate ruler of the Kikuyus of the district.

Kinanjui was a friend of mine, and had been helpful to
me on many occasions. His manyatta, to which I had ridden
over a few times, was as dirty and as full of flies as those of
the other Kikuyus. But it was much bigger than any other
I had seen, for in his position of a Chief Kinanjui had given
himself over fully to the joys of marriage. The village was
alive with wives of his of all ages, from skinny toothless old
hags on crutches to slim, moon-faced, gazelle-eyed wenches,
their arms and long legs wound up in shining copper wire.
His children were everywhere, in clusters, like the flies. The
young men, his sons, erect, with decorated heads, went to
and fro, and caused much trouble. Kinanjui had told me
once that he had at the moment fifty-five sons who were
Morani.



OUT OF AFRICA

Sometimes the old Chief would come walking over to my
farm, in a gorgeous fur-cloak, accompanied by two or three
white-haired senators and a few of his warrior-sons, on a
friendly visit, or to take a rest from governmental affairs.
He would then pass the afternoon in one of the Verandah
chairs that had been carried out on the lawn for him, smok-
ing the cigars that I sent him out, with his councillors and
his guard squatting on the grass round him. My houseboys
and squatters, when they had news of his arrival, came and
grouped themselves there, and entertained him with the hap-
penings on the farm, the whole company forming a sort of
political Club under the tall trees. Kinanjui in these meet-
ings had a manner of his own: when he thought that the
discussions were dragging out too long, he leant back in his
chair, and, while still keeping the fire in his cigar alive, he
closed his eyes and drew his breath deeply and slowly, in a
low regular snore, a sort of official, pro forma sleep, which
he may have cultivated for use in his own Council of State.
I sometimes had a chair moved out for a talk with him, and
on these occasions Kinanjui sent away everybody, to point
out that now the world was going to be governed in earnest.
He was not, at the time I knew him, the man that he had been,
life had taken much out of him. But when he talked freely
and openly, for my private ear, he showed much originality
of mind, and a rich, daring, imaginative spirit; he had thought
the matter of life over and held his own strong views upon it.

A few years earlier a thing had happened which had
strengthened the friendship between me and Kananjui.

He came to my house one day when I was lunching with
a friend who was on his way up country; I had no time to
give the Kikuyu Chief till my friend had gone. Kinanjui
would expect to be offered a drink while he was waiting,
and after his long walk in the sun, but I did not have enough
142



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

of one thing to make up a glassful, so my guest and I filled
a tumbler with all the different sorts of strong liquor that I
had in the house. I thought that the stronger I made it, the
longer it would keep Kinanjui occupied, and I took it out
to him myself. But Kinanjui, after having with a little gentle
smile just wetted his lips, gave me as deep a glance as I have
ever had from a man, laid his head back and emptied the
glass to the last drop.

Half an hour later, when my friend had just driven off,
my houseboys came in and said: “Kinanjui is dead.” I felt,
in one moment, the tragedv and the scandal rise up before
me like great grave shadows. I w^ent out to see him.

He w^as lying on the ground in the shade of the kitchen,
with no expression whatever in his face, with blue lips and
fingers, dead-cold. It was like having shot an Elephant: by
an act of yours a mighty and majestic creature, which has
walked the earth, and held his own opinions of everything,
is walking it no more. He looked degraded as well, for the
Kikuyu had poured water over him, and had taken off him
his big cloak of monkey-skin. Naked he was like an animal
when you have cut from it the trophy, for the sake of which
you have killed it.

I meant to send Farah for a doctor, but we could not get
the car started, and Kinanjui's people kept on begging us to
wait a little before we did anything.

An hour later, as I was going out again, with a heavy
heart, to talk with them, my boys came in to me once more
and said: “Kinanjui has gone home.” It seemed that he had
suddenly got up, draped his cloak about him, and his re-
tainers round him, and had walked off, the nine miles to his
village, without a word.

After this time, I believe, Kinanjui felt that I had run a
risk, even braved a danger,— for you are not allowed to give

143



OUT OF AFRICA

Natives alcohol,— to make him happy. He had been to the
farm since, and had smoked a cigar with us, but he had not
mentioned a drink. I would have given it to him had he
asked for it, but I knew that he would not ask any more.

I now sent a runner to Kinanjui’s village and explained to
him the whole affair of the shooting. I asked him to come
over to the farm to finish it. I suggested that we should give
Wainaina the cow and calf of which Kaninu had talked, and
then let the whole matter finish at that. I was looking for-
ward to Kinanjui’s arrival, for he had the quality, which
everyone values in a friend, of being effective.

By this letter of mine, the case, that had for some time
been becalmed, fetched wind and ended up dramatically.

One afternoon, as I was riding back to my house, I just
caught sight of a car that came along at a terrible speed,
rounding the drive upon two wheels. It was a scarlet car
with a lot of nickel on it. I knew it, it belonged to the
American Consul of Nairobi, and I wondered what urgent
business it was which brought the Consul to my house at
such a pace. But as I was getting off my horse at the back of
the house, Farah came out to tell me that the Chief Kinanjui
had arrived. He had come in his own car, which he had the
day before bought from the American Consul, and he did
not want to get out of it till I had seen him in it.

I found Kinanjui sitting up straight in the car, immovable
as an idol. He had on a large cloak of blue monkey-skins,
and on his head a skull-cap, of the kind which the Kikuyu
make out of sheep’s stomachs. He was always an impressive
figure, tall and broad, with no fat on him anywhere; his face
too was proud, long and bony, with a slanting forehead like
that of a Red Indian. He had a broad nose, so expressive that
it looked like the central point of the man, as if the whole
144



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM


stately figure was there only to carry the broad nose about.
Like the trunk of an Elephant, it was both boldly inquisitive
and extremely sensitive and prudent, intensely on the offen-
sive, and on the defensive as well. And an Elephant, finally,
like Kinanjui, would have a head of the very greatest nobil-
ity if he did not look so clever.

Kinanjui now did not open his mouth or wince while I
paid him my compliments on the car, he stared straight in
front of him in order that I should see his face in profile like
a head struck upon a medal. As I walked round to the front
of the car, he turned his head so as to keep his regal profile
towards me, perhaps he really had in his mind the King’s
head on the Rupee. One of his young sons was driver to
him, and the car was boiling hard. When the ceremony was
over, I invited Kinanjui to come out of the car. He collected
his big cloak round him in a majestic gesture and descended,
and in that one movement he stepped back two thousand
years, into Kikuyu justice.

On the Western wall of my house there was a stone seat
and in front of it a table made out of a mill-stone. This stone
had a tragic history: it was the upper mill-stone of the mil]
of the two murdered Indians. After the murdpr nobody
dared to take over the mill, it was empty and silent for a
long time, and I had the stone brought up to my house tc
form a table top, to remind me of Denmark.


145



OUT OF AFRICA

the mill-stone, I and Denys Finch-Hatton had one New Year
seen the new moon and the planets of Venus and Jupiter all
close together, in a group on the sky; it was such a radiant
sight that you could hardly believe it to be real, and I have
never seen it again.

I took my seat there now, with Kinanjui on the bench on
my left. Farah took up his stand on my right hand, and
therefrom kept a watchful eye on the Kikuyus, who had
been gathering round the house, and who kept coming in
as the news of Kinanjui’s arrival spread on the farm.

Farah’s attitude to the Natives of the country was a pic-
turesque thing. No more than the attire and countenance of
the Masai warriors, had it been made yesterday, or the day
before; it was the product of many centuries. The forces
which had built it up had constructed great buildings in
stone as well, but they had crumbled into dust a long time
ago.

When you first come to the country, landing at Mom-
basa, you will see, amongst the old light-grey Baobab-trees,
—which look not like any earthly kind of vegetation but like
porous fossilizations, gigantic belemnites,— grey stone ruins
of houses, minarets and wells. The same sort of ruins are to
be found all the way up the coast, at Takaunga, Kalifi and
Lamu. They are the remnants of the towns of the ancient
Arab traders in ivory and slaves.

The dhows of the traders knew all the African fairways,
and trod the blue paths to the central market-place of Zan-
zibar. They were familiar with it at the time when Aladdin
sent to the Sultan four hundred black slaves loaded with
jewels, and when the Sultana feasted with her Negro lover
while her husband was hunting, and was put to death for it.

Probably, as these great merchants grew rich, they brought
146



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

tlieir harems with them to Mombasa and Kalifi, and them-
selves remained in their villas, by the long white breakers of
the Ocean, and the flowering flaming trees, while they sent
their expeditions up into the highlands.

For from the wild hard country there, the scorched dry
plains, and unknown waterless stretches, from the land of
the broad thorn-trees along the rivers, and the diminutive,
strong-smelling wdld flowers of the black soil, came their
wealth. Here, upon the roof of Africa, wandered the heavy,
wise, majestic bearer of the ivorv. He was deep in his own
thoughts and wanted to be left to himself. But he was fol-
lowed, and shot with poisoned arrows by the little dark
Wanderobos, and with long, muzzle-loaded, silver-inlaid
guns by the Arabs; he was trapped and thrown into pits all
for the sake of his long smooth lightbrown tusks, that they
sat and waited for it at Zanzibar.

Here, also, little bits of forest-soil were cleared, burned,
and planted with sweet potatoes and maize, by a peace-
loving shy nation, which was not much good at fighting, or
at inventing anything, but wished to be left to themselves,
and which, with the ivory, was in great demand on the
market.

The greater and lesser birds of prey gathered up here:

‘"Tons les tristes oiseaux vtangeiirs de chair himmme, . . .
assembleiit, Et les tins laissaiit im crane chaiive^

Les autres aux gibets essuyant leur bee fauve

D^autreSj dhm mat rompu qiiittant les noirs agres ...”

The cold sensual Arabs came, contemptuous of death, with
their minds, out of business times, on astronomy, algebra,
and their harems. With them came their young illegitimate
half-brothers the Somali,— impetuous, quarrelsome, abstinent

147



OUT OF AFRICA

and greedy, who made up for their lack of birth by being
zealous Mohammedans, and more faithful to the command-
ments of the prophet than the children got in wedlock. The
Swaheli went along with them, slaves themselves and slave-
hearted, cruel, obscene, thievish, full of good sense and jests,
running to fat with age.

Up country they were met by the Native bird of prey of
the highlands. The Masai came, silent, like tall narrow black
shadows, with spears and heavy shields, distrustful of stran-
gers, red-handed, to sell their brothers.

The different birds must have sat together up here and
talked. Farah told me that in the old time, before the Somali
brought their own women down from Somaliland, their
young men could marry with the daughters of the Masai
only, out of all the tribes of the country. This must have
been in many ways, a strange alliance. For the Somali are
a religious people, and the Masai have no religion what-
ever, nor the slightest interest in anything above this earth.
The Somali are clean, and take much trouble over their
ablutions and hygiene, while the Masai are a dirty nation.
The Somali, too, attach the greatest importance to the
virginity of their brides, but the young Masai girls take
their morals very lightly. Farah gave me the explanation at
once. The Masai, he said, had never been slaves. They can-
not be made slaves, they cannot even be put into prison.
They die in prison if they are brought there, within three
months, so the English law of the country holds with no
penalty of imprisonment for the Masai, they are punished
by fines. This stark inability to keep alive under the yoke
has given the Masai, alone amongst aU the Native tribes,
rank with the immigrant aristocracy.

All the birds of prey lived with their burning eyes upon
the gentle rodents of the land. The Somah here had their
148



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

own position. Somalis are not good at being all on their
own, they are very excitable, and, wherever they go, if
they are left to themselves they will waste much time and
blood over their tribal moral system. But they are fine
seconds in command, and perhaps the Arab capitalists have
often given them charge of daring undertakings and diffi-
cult transports while they stayed in Mombasa themselves*
Therefore their relation to the Natives was nearly exactly
that of the sheepdog to the sheep. They watched them un-
tiringly, their sharp teeth bared. Would they die before the
coast was reached? Would they escape? The Somali have a
keen sense of money and values, they will have given up
food and sleep for the sake of their charges, and must have
come back from the expeditions worn to skin and bone.

The habit is in their blood still. When we had the Span-
ish Flu on the farm, Farah was very ill with it himself, but
he followed me about, all shivering with fever, to bring
medicine to the Squatters and to force it into them. He had
been told that paraffin was very good against the disease,
and therefore he bought paraffin for the farm. His little
brother Abdullai, who was with us then, was very bad with
flu, and Farah was much worried about him. Still, that was
only the inclination of the heart, a frivolous matter. Duty,
bread and reputation lay with the farm-labour, and the
dying sheepdog stuck to his job. Farah also had much im
sight in what was going on in Native circles, although I
do not know from where he had his knowledge, for with
the exception of the biggest amongst them, he kept no com-
pany with the Kikuyu,

The sheep themselves, the patient nations, with no teeth
or claws to them, no power and no earthly protector, got
through their destiny, as they get through it now, on their
immense gift for resignation. They did not die under the

140



OUT OF AFRICA

yoke, like the Masai, or storm against fate, as the Somali do
when they believe themselves injured, cheated or slighted.
They were friends with God in foreign countries, and in
chains. They also kept up a peculiar self-feeling in their re-
lations to those who persecuted them. They were aware
that the profit and prestige of their tormentors lay with
them themselves: they were the central figures in the chase
and the commerce, they were the goods. Upon the long
track of blood and tears, the sheep, deep in their dark
dumb hearts had made for themselves a bobtailed philosophy,
and thought not highly of the shepherds or the dogs. “You
have no rest either day or night,” they said, “you run with
your hot tongues out, panting, you are kept awake at night
so that your dry eyes smart in the daytime, all on our ac-
count. You are here on our account. You exist for our
sake, not we for your sake.” The Kikuyu of the farm at
times had a flippant manner towards Farah, as a lamb may
skip in the face of the sheepdog just to make him get up
and run.

Farah and Kinanjui met here, the sheepdog and the old
ram. Farah stood up erect in his red and blue turban, black
embroidered Arab waistcoat and Arab silk robe, thought-
ful, as decorous a figure as you would find anywhere in the
world. Kananjui was spreading himself on the stone seat,
naked but for the mantle of monkey furs on his shoulders,
an old Native, a clod of the soil of the African highlands.
They treated each other with respect, although, when they
had no direct dealings, in accordance with some ceremonial
they pretended not to see one another.

It was easy to imagine the two, a hundred years earlier,
or more, holding a converse over a consignment of slaves,
undesirable members of the tribe, of whom Kinanjui was
ridding himself. Farah would be keeping, all the time, at the
150



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

back of his mind the idea of swooping npon the old chief
himself, a fat morsel, so as to have him included in his
parcel. Kinanjui would follow, without fault, every one of
Farah’s thoughts, and, through the whole sitting, he would
be carrying the w^eight of the situation, the w^eight, too, of
his own scared and heavy heart. For he was the central
figure, he was the goods.

The bisf meeting which ^vas to settle the case of the
shooting accident began in a peaceful spirit. The people of
the farm were all pleased to see Kinanjui. The oldest squat-
ters got up and came to exchange a few^ remarks with him,
then w^aiked back and took their seats on the grass. A cou-
ple of old women from the periphery of the assembly
shrieked a greeting to me: “Jambo Jerie!^’ Jerie is a ICikuyu
name, the old w^omen of the farm addressed me by it, and
the very small children made use of it as well, but the
voung people, or the old men never called me Jerie. Kaninu
was present at the meeting, in the midst of his large family,
like a scarecrow’ somehow called to life, with burning, at-
tentive eyes. Wainaina and his mother came along and sat
a little aw^ay from the others.

I told the people, slowdy and in an effective manner, that
the matter between Kaninu and Wainaina had been settled
and the settlement put dowm on paper, Kinanjui had come
over to certify it. Kaninu was to give Wainaina a cow with
a heifer calf at foot, and by that the affair should be ended,
since nobody could stand it any longer.

Kaninu and Wainaina had been informed of the decision
beforehand, and Kaninu was instructed to have the cow and
calf ready. The activities of Wainaina w’ere of an under-
ground nature, in the daylight he w^as like a mole above the
ground, and looked as soft as a mole does there.

When I had read up the agreement I told Kaninu to bring

151



OUT OF AFRICA


along the cow. Kaninu got up and waved both arms up and
down many times to two of his young sons, who were
holding the cow behind the boys’ huts. The ring opened
while the cow and calf were slowly led into the middle of
it.

At the same moment the atmosphere of the meeting
changed, as when a thunderstorm comes up in the horizon,
and quickly rises to Zenith.

There is nothing in the world which to the Kikuyu holds
the interest and importance of a cow with a heifer calf at
foot. Bloodshed, witchcraft, sexual love or the wonders of
the white men’s world, all evaporate and disappear near the
great flaming furnace of their passion for live stock, which
smells of the stone-age, like a fire you strike with a flint.

Wainaina’s mother broke into a long wail and shook a
dry arm and finger at the cow. Wainaina joined her, all
stuttering and breaking in his speech, as if someone else
were speaking through him, he raised his voice to heaven.
He would not accept the cow, she was the oldest in Kani-
nu’s herd, and the calf that she had now got with her, that
surely was the last which she would ever bear.

The clan of Kaninu cried out and cut him short in a
furious staccato inventory of the qualities of the cow, be-
hind which you felt a great bitterness, and contempt of
death.

The people of the farm did not have it in them to remain
silent where a cow and calf were being discussed. Everyone
present gave out his opinion. The old men seized one an-
other by the arm and shook out their last asthmatic breath
in praise or condemnation of the cow. The shrill voices of
their old women fell in and followed them up, as in a
canon. The young men spat out short deadly remarks at
one another in deep voices. In two or three minutes the
152



A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM

open place by my house was boiling over like a witches
caldron.

I looked towards Farah and he looked back at me, but
like a man in a dream. I saw that he was a sword half way
out of the scabbard, which in a moment would be flashing
right and left in the strife. For the Somali are themselves
stock-owners and cattle traders. Kaninu threw me a glance
like a drowning man, who is finally carried away by the
current. I took a look at the cow. She was a grey cow with
deeply curved horns, and was standing patiently in the very
centre of the cyclone that she had raised. When all fingers
were being pointed at her she began to lick her calf. I
thought that she did have, somehow, the look of an old
cow.

At last I turned my eyes back to Kinanjui. I do not know
whether he had been looking at the cow at all. While I
looked at him he did not even wince. He sat immovable,
like some bulk without either intelligence or sympathies
just set down by my house. He turned his side to the
screaming crowd, and I realized how much the profile is
the true face of a king. It is a Native faculty thus to trans-
form yourself, in a single movement, into lifeless matter. I
do not think that Kinanjui could have spoken or moved
without fanning the flames of passion, as it was he kept sit-
ting on them to quell them. Not everybody could have
done it.

Little by little the fury died dowm, the people stopped
shrieking and began to talk in an everyday manner, in the
end they became silent one by one. Wainaina's mother,
when she thought that nobody watched her, crawled a few
steps on her stick to have a closer look at the cow. Farah
turned and came back to civilization, with a little, wry
smile.


153

When everything was quiet we made the parties in the
case come round to the mill-stone table, dip their thumb in
cart-grease, and press their thumb-mark down upon the
document of the agreement. Wainaina did it very reluc-
tantly, whimpering a little when he set his thumb to the
paper, is if it was burning him. The agreement ran as fol-
lows:

The following agreement has been made at Ngong
co-day, the 26th of September, between Wainaina wa Bemu
and Kaninu wa Muture. The Chief ICinanjui is present here
and sees it aU.

The agreement states that Kaninu shall pay to Wainaina
a cow with a heifer calf. This cow and heifer calf shall be
given to Wainaina’s son Wanyangerri, who was, on the
19th of December last year, shot by a shotgun which was
fired by mistake by Kaninu’s son Kabero. The cow and
calf shall be the property of Wanyangerri.

With the payment of this cow and her heifer calf the
Shaurie shall be finally settled. Nobody, after this, must
speak of it or mention it at aU.

I j |e had many visitors to the farm. In Pioneer conn*
YV tries hospitality is a necessity of life not to the
travellers alone but to the settlers. A visitor is a friend, he
brings news, good or bad, which is bread to the hungry
minds in lonely places. A real friend who comes to the
house is a heavenly messenger, who brings the panis
angel orum.

When Denys Finch-Hatton came back after one of his
long expeditions, he was starved for talk, and found me
on the farm starved for talk, so that we sat over the din-
ner-table into the small hours of the morning, talking of all
the things we could think of, and mastering them all, and
laughing at them. White people, w^ho for a long time live
alone with Natives, get into the habit of saying what they
mean, because they have no reason or opportunity for dis-
simulation, and when they meet again their conversation
keeps the Native tone. We then kept up the theory that the
wild Masai tribe, in their manyatta under the hills, would
see the house all afire, like a star in the night, as the peasants
of Umbria saw the house wherein Saint Francis and Saint
Clare were entertaining one another upon theology.

The greatest social functions of the farm were the

157



OUT OF AFRICA

NgOTnaSy— the big Native dances. At these occasions v^^e en-
tertained up to fifteen hundred or two thousand guests.
The entertainment offered by the house was however in
itself modest. We would give the old bald mothers of the
dancing Morani and the the maidens,— snuff, and

the children,— at those dances to which children were
brought,— sugar, distributed by Kamante in wooden spoons,
and I sometimes asked the D.C.’s permission for my Squat-
ters to make tembu, a deadly drink, fabricated from sugar
cane. But the real performers, the indefatigable young
dancers, brought the glory and luxmy of the festivity with
them, they were immune to foreign influence, and concen-
trated upon the sweetness and fire within themselves. One
thing only did they demand from the outside world: a space
of level ground to dance on. This was to be found near my
house, the big lawn was plain under the trees, and the
square, in the forest between my boys’ huts, had been laid
out level. For this reason the farm was highly thought of by
the young people of the country, and the invitations to my
balls much valued.

The Ngomas were held sometimes in the day and some-
times at night. In the day-time the Ngomas needed more
room, since they brought with them as many onlookers as
dancers; they therefore took place on the lawn. At most
Ngomas the dancers stand in a large circle, or in a number
of smaller circles, and there keep jumping up and down,
the head thrown back, or stamping the ground to a rhythm,
throwing themselves forward on one foot, and back on to
the other, or again slowly and solemnly walking round
sideways with their faces to the centre of the ring, the
prominent dancers separating themselves from the ring, to
perform, jump, and run in the middle of it. The day-time
Ngomas left their mark stamped upon the lawn in larger
158



VISITORS TO THE FARM

and smaller dry brown rings, as if the grass had here been
burnt away by fire, and these magic rings would only
slowly disappear.

The big day-time Ngomas had the character more of i
fair than of a ball. Crowds of onlookers followed the
dancers and grouped themselves under the trees. When the
rumour of the Ngoma had spread widely enough we
would even see here the flighty ladies of Nairobi,— the Ma-
laya, a pretty word in Swaheli,— arriving in style, in Ali
Khan’s mule-traps, all wrapped in lengths of gay large-
patterned calico, and looking, when seated, like large flowers
on the grass. The honest young girls on the farm in their
traditional oiled and greased leather skirts and mantles, took
up their position close to them, and frankly discussed their
clothes and manners, but the beauties of the town, cross-
legged, remained as quiet as glass-eyed dolls of dark wood,
and smoked their little cigars. Swarms of children, enrap-
tured by the dances, and keen to learn and imitate, stormed
from one ring to another, or were carried away to form
little dancing-rings of their own on the outskirts of the
lawn, and there jumped up and down.

The Kikuyu, when going to a Ngoma, rub themselves
all over with a particular kind of pale red chalk, which is
much in demand and is bought and sold; it gives them a
strangely bloiid look. The colour is neither of the animal
nor the vegetable world, in it the young people themselves
look fossilized, like statues cut in rock. The girls in their
demure, bead-embroidered, tanned leather garments cover
these, as well as themselves, with the earth, and look all one
with them,— clothed statues in which the folds and draperies
are daintily carried out by a skilled artist. The young men
are naked for an Ngoma, but on such occasions make
much out of their coiffures, clapping the chalk on to their

159

manes and pigtails, and carrying their limestone heads high.
During my last years in Africa, the Government forbade
the people to put chalk on the head. In both sexes the rig-
out is of the greatest effect: diamonds and high decora-
tions will not impart to their bearers a more decided gala
appearance. Whenever at a distance you catch sight, in the
landscape, of a group of red-chalked Kikuyu on the march,
you feel the atmosphere vibrating with festivity.

An open-air dance in the day suffers from lack of limita-
tion. The stage is far too big for it,— where does it begin
and where end? The small figures of the individual dancers
may be all dyed, with the entire back-part of an ostrich
floating behind their heads, and the bold cavalier-like cock-
spurs made of Colobus-monkey skin at the heels, they can-
not help looking spread and scattered under the tall trees.
The show,— including larger and smaller rings of dancers,
spread-out groups of onlookers, and children running to
and fro,— flings your eyes from one corner of it to the other.
The whole scene has some likeness to those old pictures of
a battle, observed from an eminence, in which you will see
the cavalry advancing at one side, while the artillery takes
up its position at the other, and isolated figures of ordnance
ofiicers gallop diagonally across the field of view.

The day-time Ngomas were likewise very noisy affairs.
The dancing music from flutes and drums was often
drowned in the clamour from the audience, the dancing
girls themselves gave out a strange, long-drawn and shrill
shriek when, in one of the figures executed by male dancers,
a Moran made a jump, or swung his spear over his head,
in an exceptionally fine manner. An unbroken stream of
congenial conversation was kept up amongst the old people
on the grass. It was pleasant here to watch a couple of
ancient Kikuyu women carousing, with a calabash between
i6o

them, absorbed in gay talk, presumably of the days wheri
they had themselves cut a figure in the dancing ring, their
faces more and more radiant with happiness as, in the
course of the afternoon, the sun sank lower, and the supply
of tembu in the calabash as well At times, when the group
was joined by a couple of old husbands, one of the women
W'Ould be so carried away by the memories of her young
days that she stumbled to her feet and, flapping her arms
took a running step or two in the true Ndito manner. She
was ignored by the crowd, but enthusiastically applauded
by her little circle of contemporaries.

But the Ngomas of the night were set about in earnest.

They w^ere held in the autumn only, after the maize-
harvesting, and below the full moon. I do not think that
they had any religious significance to them, but they may
have had so once; the manner of the performers and on-
lookers suggested a mysterious and sacred moment. These
dancers may have been a thousand years old. Some of
them,— which was highly approved of by the mothers and
grandmothers of the dancers,— were held by the white set-
tlers to be immoral, they felt that they must have them
prohibited by law. One time, when I came back from a
holiday in Europe, I found that twenty-five of my young
warriors had, in the height of the coffee-picking season,,
been sent to jail by my Manager for having danced a for-
bidden dance at a night Ngoma on the farm. My Manager
informed me that his wife could not possibly put up with
the dance. I upbraided the elders of the Squatters for hav-
ing held their Ngoma near my Manager’s house, but they
gravely explained to me that they had been dancing at
Kathegu’s manyatta, four or five miles away from it. I then
had to go to Nairobi to talk matters over with our D.C.,

i6i

who let the whole lot of dancers come back to the farm to
pick coffee.

The night dances were fine spectacles. Here you were
not in doubt as to the theatre' of the show, it was formed
by the fires and extended as far out as the light spread, in-
deed fire was the central principle of the Ngoma. It was not
really needed for the dancing, for the moonlight of the
African Highlands is marvellously clear and white; it was
brought to create an effect. The fire made of the dancing
place a stage of the first order, it collected all the colours
and movements within it into a unity.

Natives will rarely overdo an effect. They had no great
flaming bonfires lighted. Firewood was carried to the danc-
ing-place during the day before the dance by the Squatter
women of the farm, who will have looked upon themselves
as hostesses to the feast, and was here piled up in the centre
of the dancing-ring. The old women who honoured the
ball with their presence at night took their seats round this
central pile, and from there a row of small fires, like a
circle of stars, was fed through the hours of the night.
The dancers again were dancing and running outside the
fires, with the forest-night as a background. The place had
to be fairly big or the heat and smoke would get into the
eyes of the old onlookers, but it was all the same an en-
closed place in the world, as if it had been a large house
for the joint use of all within it.

Natives have no sense or taste for contrasts, the umbilical
cord of Nature has, with them, not been quite cut through.
They held their Ngomas only during the time of the full
anoon. When the moon did her best they did theirs. With
the landscape bathing and swimming in gentle powerful light
from the sky, to the great illumination over Africa they
added their little red-hot glow,

162



VISITORS TO THE FARM


The guests arrived in small parties, sometimes three at
a time, sometimes a dozen or fifteen,— friends who came to-
gether by appointment, or who had joined company on
the road. Manv of these dancers had walked hi teen miles
to ofet to the Ncroma. When travellinGr many toirether they
brought flutes or drums with them, so that, on the night of
the big dance, all the roads and pathw^ays of the country
would resound and ring with music, like jingles shaken at
the face of the moon. At the entrance to the dancing-ring
the wanderers paused and waited for the ring to open to
them; sometimes, w hen they came from very far away, or
Avere sons of the big neighbouring Chiefs, they were re-
ceived into it by one of the old Squatters or prominent
dancers of the farm, or by the monitors of the dance.

The monitors of the Ngoma were young men from the
farm like the others, but they \vere there to keep up the
ceremonial of the dance, and made the most of their posi-
tion. Before the dancing began, they strutted up and down
in front of the dancers with knitted brows and a grave face;
as the dance grew livelier they ran from one side of the
ring to another, to watch that everything was going as it
should. They were effectively armed, carrying bundles of
sticks tied together, the one end of Avhich they kept burn-
ing, by dipping them from time to time into the fire. They
kept a sharp eye upon the dancers, and wherever they
espied anything of an unseemly nature going on, they -were
at them at once; with a terrible expression and a furious
snarl they hurled their whole bunch of sticks, the burning
end foremost, straight at the body of the offender. The
victim was seen to be bent double at the stroke, but he
never gave a sound. Perhaps a burn of this kind was no dis-
honourable wound to be carrying away from an Ngoma.

In one of the dances the girls would stand demurely upon

163



OUT OF AFRICA

the feet of the young men and clasp them found the waist,
while the young warriors with an outstretched arm at each
side of the girl’s head, held on to their spear with both
hands, from time to time lifting it and striking it down to
the ground with all their might. It made a pretty picture,
of the young women of the tribe having taken refuge at
the bosom of their men against some great danger, and of
the men guarding them, even by letting them stand on their
feet, protecting them against snakes or any other dangers
from the ground. As the dance went on for hours the faces
of the dancers took on an expression of angehc ecstasy, as
if they were really all ready to die for one another.

They had other dances in which the dancers ran in and
out amongst the fires, where one head-dancer made a num-
ber of very high jumps and leaps, and there was much
swinging of spears; it was, I believe, built upon a lion-hunt.

They had singers at the Ngoma, as well as flutes and
drums. Some of these singers were famous all over the
country, and were made to come from far away. Their
singing was more a rhythmical recitation than a song. They
were improvisators, and made up their ballads oflF-hand,
with the quick, attentive chorus of the dancers joining in.
It was pleasant to listen, in the night air, to the one gentle
voice being raised, and to the regularly repeated, measured
call of young voices. But as it went on all night, with the
drums falling in for an effect from time to time, it became
both deadly monotonous and strangely excruciating to
hear, as if you could not bear either to have it going on
for one moment longer, or to have it ever stopped.

The most famous singer of my day came from Dago-
retti. He had a clear strong voice and was, besides, himself
a great dancer. When singing he would walk or run inside
ihe dancing-ring in a long, sliding stride, half-kneeling at
164



VISITORS TO THE FARM

every step, he held the one flat hand to the corner of his
mouth; it was probably done to concentrate the sound, but
it gave effect of a great dangerous secret being confided
to the congregation. He looked like the African echo it-
self. He used to move his audience to happiness or to a war-
like mood as he chose, or to real convulsions of laughter.
He sang one formidable song, a war song, in which the
singer is, I believe, imagined running from village to village
calling the nation to war, and describing to them the massa-
cre and the loot. A hundred years ago it would have made
the blood of the white immigrants run cold. But generally
he was not so terrifying. One night he sang three songs,
which I asked Kamante to translate to me. The first of
them was a fantasy: the whole party of the dancers were
imagined getting hold of a ship and sailing to Volaia. The
second song, Kamante explained to me, was all in praise of
the old women, the mothers and grandmothers of the singer
and the dancers. This song sounded sweet to me, it was
long, and must have described in detail the wisdom and
kindness of the toothless bald old Kikuyu wives, who lis-
tened at the pile of firewood in the centre of the place,
and nodded their heads. The third song was short, but drew
great shouts of laughter from everybody, the singer had to
raise his shrill voice to be heard through it, and laughed
himself as he sang. The old women, who had now been put
in good humour by being so strongly flattered, beat their
thighs, and threw up big gapes, like crocodiles, at it. Ka-
mante was loth to translate it to me, he said it was nonsense,
and gave it me only very much shortened. The theme of it
was simple: after a recent epidemic of plague, the Govern-
ment had set a price upon each dead rat handed into the
D.C.’s,— the song described how the rats, universally pur-
sued, were taking refuge in the beds of the old and young

i6c



OUT OF AFRICA

women of the tribe, and what happened to them there. It
must have been amusing in its details, which I did not get;
Kamante himself, while translating it to me very much
against his wish, at times could not repress a sour smile.

At one of the night Ngomas a dramatic incident took
place.

The Ngoma was a farewell feast, given in my honour a
short time before I was going to Europe on a visit. We had
had a good year, it was held in great style, there may have
been fifteen hundred Kikuyu present. The dance had been
going on for a few’ hours; as I came out to have another
look at it before going to bed, a chair was placed for me
with its back to one of the boys’ huts, and I was entertained
by a couple of the old Squatters.

All at once a great stir ran through the ring of dancers,
a deep movement of surprise or fear, a curious sound, as
when the wdnd blow^s through a bed of rushes. The dance
slowed up, slow^ed up, but it did not stop yet. I asked one
of the old men what was the matter. He answered quickly,
in a low voice: “Masai na-kudja,”-~the Masai are coming.

The new^s must have been brought by a runner, for it
lasted some time before anything more happened, probably
the Kikuyu were sending back to say that their guests
would be received. It was against the law for the Masai to
come to a Kikuyu Ngoma, too much trouble had arisen
from this kind of thing in the past. My houseboys came
up and stood by my chair; everybody looked towards the
entrance of the dancing-ground. When the Masai came in,
the dance stopped altogether.

There were twelve young Masai warriors walking in, and
when they had taken a few steps they stopped, waited, and
looked neither right nor left; they blinked a little towards
the fire. They were naked except for their weapons and
166



VISITORS TO THE FARM

their magnificent head-dresses. One of them had on the
liomskin head-dress of the Moran at war. A broad stripe of
scarlet was painted vertically from the knee to the foot, as
if the blood was running dowm the leg. They stood erect,
stiff-legged, their heads thrown back, silent and deadly
grave, their attitude w^as at the same time that of the con-
queror and the prisoner. It was felt that they had come to
the Ngoma against their own will. The dull beating of the
drum had run across the river into the Reserve, had gone
on, and gone on, and troubled the hearts of the young
w arriors there; tw'elve of them had not had it in them to
resist the call.

The Kikuyu were deeply agitated, too, but they behaved
well to their guests. The chief dancer of the farm welcomed
them into the dancing ring, where in deep silence they took
their place, and the dance was begun once more. It was,
however, different from what it had been before, the air
was loaded now. The drums began to beat in a louder
voice, and a more rapid rhythm. Had the Ngoma gone on,
we should have seen some striking feats, when Kikuyu and
Masai would have taken upon themselves to sho\y one an-
other their vigour and skill as dancers. But it did not come
to that: there are things which can not be carried through
even with the good will of everybody concerned.

What happened I do not know. All of a sudden the ring
swayed, and was broken, some one shrieked aloud, in some
seconds the whole place before me was a mass of running,
thronging people, there was the sound of blows and of
bodies falling to the ground, and over our heads the night
air was undulating with spears. We all got up, even the wise
old women of the centre, who crawled on to the stacks of
firewood to see Avhat was going on.

When the emotion had calmed down, and the storming

167



OUT OF AFRICA

crowd had dissolved again, I found myself in the centre of
the swarm, with a little cleared space round me. Two of
the old Squatters came up to me, and reluctantly explained
what had happened: the violation of law and order com-
mitted by the Masai, and the present state of things: a Masai
and three Kikuyu were badly wounded, “cut to pieces,”
their expression was. Would I now, they went on gravely,
consent to sew them up again?— otherwise everybody was
likely to get much trouble from the the Govern-

ment. I asked the old man what the fighters had had cut
oflF. “The head,” he answered proudly, with the Native in-
stinct to make the most of a catastrophe. At that moment
Kamante was seen to advance across the place, carrying a
long-threaded darning needle, and my thimble. I still hesi-
tated, and at that moment old Awaru came forward. He
had learned tailoring during the seven years that he had
been in prison. He must have been looking for an oppor-
tunity for practising, and showing oflF his craft, he volun-
teered to take charge of the case, and at once the interest
concentrated upon him. He did indeed sew up the wounded,
they got well under his hands, and he himself in after times
made much of the achievement, but Kamante told me in
confidence that the heads had not been off.

As the presence of the Masai at the dance had been il-
legal, we for a long time had to conceal the wounded Masai
in the hut reserved for white visitors’ servants. Here he re-
covered, and from here in the end he disappeared without
a word of thanks to Awaru. It comes hard, I believe, to
the heart of a Masai to be wounded,— and healed,— by
Kikuyu.

When towards the end of the night of the Ngoma, I
walked out to ask for news of the wounded people, I found,
in the grey morning air, the fires still smouldering. A num-
i68



VISITORS TO THE FARM


ber of young Klikuyu were in action round them, leaping
and poking long sticks into the embers, under the direction
of a very old Squatter wife, Wainaina’s mother. They
were making a spell to prevent the Masai from having any
success in love with the Kikuyu girls.

The Ngomas were neighbourly and traditionally social
functions. In the course of time, it was the younger brothers
and sisters and, later on, the sons and daughters of the first
dancers known by me, who came to the dancing-ground.

But we had visitors from distant countries as well. The
monsoon blows from Bombay: wise and experienced old
people travelled in ships, all the way from India, and came
to the farm.

There was in Nairobi a big Indian timber merchant by
the name of Choleim Hussein, with whom I had done many
deals when I was first clearing my land and who was a
zealous Mohammedan and a friend of Farah’s. One day he
arrived at the house and asked for permission to bring a
High Priest from India on a visit. He was coming all over
the Sea, Choleim Hussein told me, to inspect his congrega-
tions of Mombasa and Nairobi: the congregations on their
side were eager to entertain him well, and, working their
brains, they could think of nothing better than this visit
to the farm. Would I let him come? WTien I said that he
should be welcome, Choleim Hussein went on to explain
that the rank and holiness of the old man were such that he
could eat nothing which had been cooked in pots ever



VISITORS TO THE FARM


used by Infidels. But I need not bother about that, lie
quickly added, the Alohammedan congregation of Nairobi
would prepare the meal and send it out in good time; would
I only let the High Priest partake of it in my house? As I
agreed, Choleim Hussein after a little while took up the
matter again, with difficulty. There was one more point,
only one. Wherever the High Priest went, etiquette de-
manded that he should receive a present, in a house like
mine it could be no less than one hundred Rupees. But I
need not let that worry me, he hurried to explain, the
money had been collected amongst the Mohammedans of
Nairobi, who only asked me to hand it over to the Priest.
But would the Priest, I asked, believe it to be a present from
me? Of this I could extract no explanation from Choleim
Hussein, there are times when coloured people cannot make
themselves clear to save their lives. At first I declined the
role intended for me, but looking at the disappointed faces
of Choleim Hussein and Farah, which had a moment before
been radiant with hope, I gave up my pride and thought
that I would let the High Priest think what he liked.

On the day of the visit I had forgotten about it and gone
out in the field to try my new tractor. Titi, Kamante’s little
brother, was sent out to me there. The tractor made such
a noise that I could not hear what he had got to say, and
it was so difficult to start that I dared not stop it; Titi ran
alongside of it all through the field like a small mad dog,
panting and snapping in the deep ground and the long thick
tail of dust, until at the end of the field we came to a pause.
^^The Priests have come,” he roared to me. “What Priests?”
I asked back. “All the Priests,” he proudly explained; they
had arrived in four carts, six in each. I went with, him back
to the house, and as I got near I caught sight of a swarm
of white-robed figures spread on the lawn, as if a flight of big

171



OVT OF AFRICA


white birds had settled round my house, or a company of
angels swooped on to the farm. It will have been a whole
Spiritual Court sent from India to keep up the flame of
orthodoxy in Africa. There was, however, no mistaking the
dignified figure of the High Priest as he advanced towards
me, escorted by two Subordinates, and, at a respectful dis-
tance, by Choleim Hussein. He was a very short old man
with a delicate, refined face, as if carved in very old ivory.
The retinue drew near, to stand guard upon our meeting,
and then withdraw; I was expected to entertain my guest
alone.

We could not speak a word to one another, for he un-
derstood neither English nor Swaheli, and I did not know
his language. We had to express our great mutual respect
by pantomime. He had already, I saw, been shown the
house, all the plate that it possessed was set out on the
table, and flowers arranged according to Indian and Somali
taste. I went and sat down with him on the stone seat to
the West. There, under the breathless attention of the on-
lookers, I handed him over the hundred Rupees which were
wrapped up in a green handkerchief belonging to Choleim
Hussein.

I had somehow been prejudiced against the old Priest on
account of his preciseness,— on seeing him so very old and
small I, for a moment, thought that the situation might be
awkward to him. But as we sat together in the afternoon
sun, in no way pretending to keep up any conversation, but
‘holding one another company in a friendly spirit, I felt that
to him nothing at all could be awkward. He conveyed a
strange impression of being in safety, and completely se-
cure. He had a courteous little manner with him, and
smiled and nodded, as I pointed out the hills and the tall
lirees to him, as if he were interested in everything, and

.172

incapable of surprise at anything, I wondered if this con-
sistency was produced by an entire ignorance of the evil
of the world, or by a deep knowledge and acceptance of
it. For whether there be no venomous snakes in the world,
or whether you shall have arrived, by injecting ever-
stronger doses of venom into your blood, at a stage of per-
fect immunity to it, in the end it must come to the same
thing. The look of the old man’s calm face w^as that of a
very young infant, wdiich has not yet learnt to speak, and
which is interested in everything, and by the nature of
things incapable of surprise. I might have sat, on the stone
seat, through an hour of the afternoon, in the company of
a very small child, a noble infant, some old Master’s child
Jesus,— from time to time touching the rocker of the cradle
with a spiritual foot. The faces of very old women of the
world, who have seen all of it, and through it, will have
that same look. It is not a masculine expression,— it goes
with the swaddling-clothes and the woman’s frock, and
went well with the beautiful white cashmere robes of my
old guest. In a person in male clothes I have seen it only in
a clever clown in a Circus.

The old man w^as tired, and would not get up, w^hile the
other Priests were taken by Choleim Hussein down to the
river to see the mill. As he was like a bird himself he
seemed to take an interest in birds. I had at that time a tame
stork by the house, and I kept a flock of geese which were
never killed, but were there to make the place look like
Denmark. The old Priest showed much interest in them;
by pointing to the corners of the world he tried to find
out from where they came. My dogs were on the lawn, to
make the millennium character of the afternoon perfect. I
had thought that Farah and Choleim Hussein would have
had them shut up in the kennel, for Choleim Hussein, as a

275

true Alohammedan, was all in a panic about them whenever
he came to the farm to do business. But here they were
walking about, amongst the white-robed Clergy, indeed
the lion by the lamb. Those were the dogs supposed by
Ismail to know a Mohammedan by sight.

Before he went away the High Priest gave me, in mem-
ory of his visit, a ring with a pearl. I felt then that I, too,
wanted to give him something, in addition to the sham
gift of the Rupees, and I sent Farah to the store to fetch
the skin of a lion which had a short time ago been shot on
the farm. The old man took hold of one of the big claws,
and with a clear attentive eye tried the sharpness of it on
his cheek-

After he had gone away, I wondered whether he had
taken into his lean, noble head every single thing within
the horizon of the farm, or nothing whatever. Something
he had noticed, for three months later I had a letter from
India, very wrongly addressed and delayed in the post. In
it an Indian prince asked me to sell to him one of my “grey
dogs,” of which a High Priest had made mention to him,
md to fix my own price.








k




Of one group of visitors, who played a great part on the
farm, I cannot write much, for they would not have liked
it. Those were Farah’s women.

When Farah married, and brought his wife from Somali-
land to the farm, with her came a lively and gentle little
flight of dusky doves: her mother, her younger sister, and
a young cousin who had been brought up with the family.
Farah told me that such was the custom of his country.
The marriages of Somaliland are arranged by the elders of
the families with consideration as to the birth, wealth and
reputation of the young people; in the best families the
bride and bridegroom have not seen one another till the
wedding-day. But the Somali are a chivalrous nation, and
do not leave their maidens unprotected. It is good manners
in a new-married husband to take up his abode in his wife’s
village for six months after the wedding, during this time
she may still hold her own as a hostess and a person of
local knowledge and influence. Sometimes he cannot do
so, then the bride’s female relations do not hesitate to keep
her company a bit into married life, even when this to
them means lifting, and wandering into distant countries.

The circle of Somali women in my household was later

17^



OUT OF AFRICA

completed by a little motherless girl of the tribe whom
Farah took on, not, I think, without an eye to a likely profit
when her time to marry should come, after the pattern of
Mordecai and Esther. This little girl was an exceedingly
bright and vivacious child, and it was a curious thing to
see how, as she grew up, the maidens took her in hand, and
scrupulously formed her into a young virgin comrne il fctuU
When she first came to live with us she was eleven years
old, and was ever breaking away from the domain of the
family to follow me about. She rode my pony and carried
my gun, or she would run with the Eokuyu Totos to the
fishing pond, tucking up her skirts and galloping bare-
footed round the rushy bank with a landing-net. The little
Somali girls have their hair all shaven off, leaving only a
ring of dark curls round the head and one long lock at the
top of it; it is a pretty fashion, and it gave the child the air
of a very gay and malicious young monk. But with time,
and under the influence of the grown-up girls, she was
-transformed, and was herself fascinated and possessed by
the process of her transformation. Exactly as if a heavy
weight had been tied on to her legs, she took to walking
slowly, slowly; she held her eyes cast down after the best
pattern, and made it a point of honour to disappear at the
arrival of a stranger. Her hair was cut no more, and when
the day came that it was long enough, it was, by the other
girls, parted and plaited into a number of little pigtails. The
Novice gave herself up gravely and proudly to all the hard-
ships of the rite; it was felt that she would rather die than
fall short in her duties towards it.

The old woman, Farah’s mother-in-law, was, Farah told
me, in her own country held in high esteem on account of
the excellent education which she had given her daughters.
They were there the glass of fashion and the mould of

maidenly form. Indeed here were three young women of
the most exquisite dignity and demureness; I have never
known ladies more ladylike. Their maiden modesty was ac-
centuated by the style of their clothes. They Avore skirts
of imposing amplitude, it took, I know,— for I have often
bought silk or calico for them,— ten yards of material to
make one of them. Inside these masses of stuff their slim
knees moved in an insinuating and mysterious rhythm:

The mother herself was an impresswe figure, very st?out,
with the powerful and benevolent placidity of a female
elephant, contented in her strength. I have never seen her
angry. Teachers and pedagogues ought to have envied
her that great inspiring quality Avhich she had in her; in her
hands education was no compulsion, and no drudgery, but
a great noble conspiracy into which her pupils Avere by
privilege admitted. The little house, that I had built for
them in the Avoods, Avas a small High-school of White
Magic, and the three young girls, Avho Avalked so gently
upon the forest-paths round it, Avere like three young
witches Avho Avere studying at it as hard as they could, for
at the end of their apprenticeship great mightiness Avould
be theirs. They were competing in excellency in a con-
genial spirit; probably A\'^here you are in reality upon the
market, and have your price openly discussed, rivalry takes
on a frank and honest character. Farah’s wife, Avho was no
longer in suspense as to her price, Avas holding a special po-
sition, like that of the good Pupil who has already obtained

a scholarship in witchcraft; she might be obsenred in con-
fidential talks with the old Head Magician, and such an
honour never fell to the maidens.

All the young women had a high idea of their own
value. A Alohammedan virgin cannot marry beneath her,
such a thing would call down the gravest blame upon her
family. A man may marry beneath him,— that is good enough
for him,— and young Somalis have been known to take
Masai wives. But while a Somali girl may marry into Arabia,
an Arab girl cannot marry into Somaliland, for the Arabs
are the superior race on account of their nearer relationship
with the Prophet, and, amongst the Arabs themselves, a
maiden belonging to the Prophet’s family cannot marry a
husband outside it. By virtue of their sex, the young fe-
males of the race have a claim to an upward social career.
They themselves innocently compared the principle to that
of a stud-farm of purebreds, for the Somali think very
highly of mares.

By the time that we had become well acquainted, the
girls asked me if it could be true what they had heard,
that some nations in Europe gave away their maidens to
their husbands for nothing. They had even been told, but
they could not possibly realize the idea, that there was one
tribe so depraved as to pay the bridegroom to marry the
bride. Fie and shame on such parents, and on girls who gave
themselves up to such treatment. Where was their self-
respect, where their respect for woman, or for virginity?
If they themselves had had the misfortune to be born into
that tribe, the girls told me, they would have vowed to go
into their grave unmarried.

In our days we have in Europe no opportunity to study
the technique of maidenly prudery, and from the old books
I had failed to catch the charm of it. Now I understood
*78

how my grandfather and great-grandfather were forced to
their knees. The Somali system was at once a natural neces-
sity and a fine art, it was both religion, strategy, and ballet,
and was practised in all respects with due devotion, dis-
cipline and dexterity. The great sweetness of it lay in the
play of opposite forces within it. Behind the eternal prin-
ciple of refutation, there was much generosity; behind the
pedantry what risibility, and contempt of death. These
daughters of a fighting race went through their ceremonial
of primness as through a great graceful war-dance; butter
would not melt in their mouth., neither would they rest
'till they had drunk the heart’s blood of their adversary,
they figured like three ferocious young she-wolves in
seemly sheep’s clothing. The Somali are wiry people, hard-
ened in deserts and on the sea. Heavy weights of life,
strenuous pressure, high waves, and long ages, must have
gone to turn their women into such hard, shining amber.

The women made Farah’s house home-like in the manner
of a nomiadic people, who may have to break their tents
at any time, with many rugs and embroidered covers hung
on the wails. Incense to them w-as an important component
to a home; many of the Somali incenses are very sweet. In
my life at the farm I saw few women, and I got into the
habit of sitting, at the end of the day, for a quiet hour with
the old woman and the girls in Farah’s house.

They took an interest in everything, and little things
pleased them. Small mishaps on the farm, and jokes on our
local affairs, set them laughing like a whole chime of jingles
in the house. When I was to teach them to knit they laughed
over it as over a comical puppet-showx

There w^as no ignorance in their innocence. They had
all assisted at childbirths and death-beds, and discussed the
particulars of them coldly with the old mother. Some«

dmes, to entertain me, they would relate fairy tales in the
style of the Arabian Nights, mostly in the comical genre,
which treated love with much frankness. It was a trait com-
mon to all these tales that the heroine, chaste or not, would
get the better of the male characters and come out of the
tale triumphant. The mother sat and listened with a little
smile on her face.

Within this enclosed women’s world, so to say, behind
the walls and fortifications of it, I felt the presence of a
great ideal, without which the garrison would not have
carried on so gallantly; the idea of a Millennium when
women were to reign supreme in the world. The old
mother at such times would take on a new shape, and sit
enthroned as a massive dark symbol of that mighty female
deity who had existed in old ages, before the time of the
Prophet’s God. Of her they never lost sight, but they were,
before all, practical people with an eye on the needs of the
movement and with infinite readiness of resource.

The young women were very inquisitive as to European
customs, and listened attentively to descriptions of the
manners, education, and clothes of white ladies, as if out to
complete their strategic education with the knowledge of
how the males of an alien race were conquered and sub-
dued.

Their owil clothes played a tremendous part in their lives,
which was no wonder, since to them they were all at once
material of war, booty of war, and symbols of victory, like
conquered banners. Their husband, the Somali, is abstinent
by nature, indifferent to food and drink and to personal
comfort, hard and spare as the country he comes from:
woman is his luxury. For her he is insatiably covetous, she
is to him the supreme good of life: horses, camels and stock
may come in and be desirable, too, but they can never out-
i8o



VISITORS TO THE FARM


weigh the wives. The Somali women encourage their men
in both inclinations of their nature. They scorn any soft-
ness in a man with much cruelty; and with great personal
sacrifices they hold up their own price. These women can-
not acquire a pair of slippers in any possible way except
through a man, they cannot own themselves but must needs
belong to some male, to a father, a brother or a husband,
but they are still the one supreme prize of life. It is a sur-
prising thing, and to the honour of both parties, w^hat
amounts of silks, gold, amber and coral the Somali women
get out of their men. At the end of the long, strenuous
trading-Safaris, the hardships, risks, stratagems and endur-
ances w^ere all turned into female apparel. The young girls,
who had no men to squeeze, in their little tent-like house
were making the most of their pretty hair and looking
forward to the time when they should be conquering the
conqueror, and extortionating the extortioner. They were
all very good at lending one another their finery, and took
pleasure in dressing up the young sister, who was the beauty
of the lot, in her married sister’s best clothes; even, with
laughter, in her cloth-of-gold head-dress, w^hich the virgin
could not lawfully wear.

The Somali are given to law-suits and long feuds, and
we were hardly ever without a case that needed Farah’s
frequent presence in Nairobi, or meetings of the tribe at
the farm. At such times the old woman, when I came to
the house, would pump me on the cases in a gentle and in-
telligent manner. She might have questioned Farah, who
would have told her all she wanted to know, for he had a
great respect for her. But she took the other course, I be-
lieve, from diplomacy. In this way she could still maintain,
should it suit her, a woman’s ignorance of men’s affairs, and
womanly incapability to understand a single word of

i8i

them. If she gave advice it should be uttered in Sibylline
fashion, divinely inspired, and nobody should ever hold
her to account.

At these big meetings of the Somali at the farm, or at the
great religious celebrations, the women had much to do
with the arrangement and the food. They were not them-
selves present at the banquet, and they could not go into
the Mosque, but they were ambitious as to the success and
splendour of the party, and did not even amongst them-
selves let out what in their hearts they thought of it all. On
these occasions they so strongly reminded me of the ladies
of a former generation in my own country, that in my
mind I saw them in bustles and long narrow trains. Not
otherwise did the Scandinavian women of the days of my
Mothers, and Grandmothers,— the civilized slaves of good-
natured barbarians,— do the honours at those tremendous
sacred masculine festivals: the pheasant-shoots and great
battues of the autumn season.

The Somali have been slave-owners for innumerable gen-
erations, and their women got on well with the Natives
and with them had an unconcerned placid way. To the
Native, service with the Somali and the Arab is less difficult
than with the white people, for the tempo of life of the
coloured races is everywhere the same. Farah’s wife was
popular with the Kikuyu of the farm, and Kamante many
times told me that she was very clever.

With those of my white friends who frequently came to
stay at the farm, like Berkeley Cole and Denys Finch-
Hatton, the young Somali women were friendly, they fre-
quently talked of them and knew a surprising lot about
them. They conversed with them, when they met, in a sis-
terly manner, their hands in the folds of their skirts. But
the relations were complicated because both Berkeley and
182



VISITORS TO THE FARM


Denys had Somali servants, and those the girls could not,
for the life of them, meet. No sooner had Jama or Bilea,
turbaned, lean and dark-eyed, shown themselves on the
farm, than my young Somali women were gone from the
face of it, not a bubble showing where they had sunk. If
during these times they wanted to see me, they came sneak-
ing round the corners of the house, drawing one of their
skirts together over their faces. The Englishmen said that
they were pleased by the confidence shown them, but in
their hearts, I believe, a little cold wind blew at the con-
sciousness of beins; thouttht so harmless.

o o

I sometimes took the girls out for a drive or a visit; 1
was careful then to question the mother as to the correct-
ness of it, for I would not begrime names that were as fresh
as Dian’s visage. To the one side of the farm lived a young
Australian married woman who was for a few years a
charming neighbour to me; she would ask the Somali girls
over for tea. Those were great occasions. They then dressed
up as pretty as a bouquet of flowers, and as we were driving
along, the car behind me nvittered like an aviary. They
took the greatest interest in the house, the clothes, even,—
as he was seen riding or ploughing in the distance,— in the
husband of my friend. As tea was served, it came out that
it was only the married sister and the children who could
partake of it, to the young girls it was forbidden as too ex-
citing. They had to content themselves with cakes and did
so demurely, with a good grace. There was some discussion
about the little girl, who was with us, —could she still drink
tea, or had she reached an age to which it would prove too
dangerous? The married sister held that she might have it
but the child gave us a deep, dark, proud glance, and re-
jected the cup.

The cousin was a pensive girl with red-brown eyes, she

183



OUT OF AFRICA

could read Arabic and knew passages of the Koran by
heart. She was of a theological turn of mind, and we had
many religious discussions and talks about the wonders of
the world. From her I learned the true paraphrase of the
story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. She would admit
Jesus Christ to have been bom of a virgin, but not as the
son of God, for God could have no sons in the flesh.
Mariammo, who was the loveliest of maidens, had been
walking in the garden, and a great angel, sent by the Lord,
with his wingfeather had touched her shoulder, from this
she conceived. In the course of our debates I one day showed
her a picture postcard of Thorvaldsen’s statue of Christ, in
the Cathedral of Copenhagen. Upon that she fell in love,
in a gentle and ecstatic way, with the Saviour. She could
never hear enough about him, she sighed and changed
colour as I narrated. About Judas she was much concerned,
—what sort of man v^as he, how could there be people like
that?— she herself would be only too happy to scratch out
his eyes. It was a great passion, in the nature of the incense
which they burned in their houses, and which, made from
dark wood grown upon distant mountains, is sweet and
strange to our senses.

I asked the French Fathers, if I might bring my party
of young Mohammedan women to the Mission, and when
they agreed m their friendly lively manner,— pleased that
something was going to happen,— we one afternoon drove
over to them, and one by one solemnly entered the cool
Church. The young women had never been in such a lofty
building, as they looked up they held their hands over their
heads to protect themselves should it fall down upon them.
There were statues in the Church, and, with the exception
of the picture postcard, they had never in their lives seen
an}rthing like them. At the French Mission there is a life-
184

size statue of the Virgin, all in white and light blue, with a
lily in her hand, and beside her another of St. Joseph with
the infant on his arm. The girls were struck dumb in front
of them, the beauty of the Virgin made them sigh. Of St.
Joseph they knew already, and they thought highly of him,
for being such a loyal husband and protector to the Virgin,
now they gave him deep thankful glances because he carried
the child for his wife as well. Farah’s wife, who was then ex-
pecting her child, kept near the Holy Family all the time she
stayed in the Church. The Fathers prided themselves much
on their Church windows, which were done up in a paper
imitation of stained glass, and represented the passion of
Christ. The young cousin became all lost and absorbed in
these windows, she walked round the Church with her eyes
on them, wringing her hands, her own knees bending as un-
der the weight of the cross. On the way home they said very
little, they were afraid, I believe, to betray their ignorance
by any questions they might make. Only a couple of days
later did they ask me if the Fathers could make the Virgin
or St. Joseph come down from their plinths.

The young cousin was married from the farm, in a pretty
bungalow which was then empty, and which I lent to the
Somalis for the occasion. The wedding was a splendid affair
and lasted for seven days. I was present at the head cere-
mony, when a procession of women, all singing, led the
bride to meet the singing procession of men who brought
the bridegroom to her. She had never seen him till then, and
I wondered if she had imagined him in the likeness of Thor-
valdsen’s Christ, or if she would have had two ideals, a hea\"-
enly and an earthly love, on the model of the romances of
chivalry. In the course of the week I drove over there more
than once. At whatever hour I arrived I found the house
ringing with festive life and fumigated with wedding in-

cense. Swcrd-dances, and great dances of the women, went
with a swing; big deals in cattle w^ere done amongst the old
men, guns were fired and mule traps from town were arriv-
ing or leaving. At night, in the light of hurricane-lamps on
the Verandah, the loveliest dyes of Arabia and Somaliland
were going in and out of the carts and the house: carmoisin,
prune pure, Sudan brown, rose bengale and Saffranine.

Farah’s son was born on the farm, Ahamed, whom they
called Saufe, which means, I believe, a saw. In his heart there
was none of the timidity of the Kikuyu children. When he
was a tiny infant, swaddled like an acorn, with hardly any
body to his dark round head, he sat up erect, and looked
you straight in the face: it was like holding a small falcon
on your hand, a lion-cub on the knee. He had inherited his
mother’s gaiety of heart, and, when he could run about, be-
came a big joyful adventurer who held much influence in
the young Native world of the farm.

Sometimes visitors from Europe drifted into the farm Hke
wrecked timber into still waters, turned and rotated, tili
in the end they were washed out again, or dissolved and
sank.

Old Knudsen, the Dane, had come to the farm, sick and
blind, and stayed there for the time it took him to die, a
lonely animal. He walked along the roads all bent over his
misery; for long periods he was without speech, for he had
no strength left over from the hard task of carrying it, or,
when he spoke, his voice, like the voice of the wolf or
hyena, was in itself a wail.

But when he recovered breath, and for a little while was
Without pain, then sparks flew from the dying fire once
more. He w^ould then come to me and explain how^ he had
got to fight with a morbid melancholic disposition in him-
self, an absurd tendency to see things black. It must be out-
reasoned, for the outward circumstances they w^ere not
amiss, they w^ere, the devil take him, not to be despised.
Only pessimism, pessimism, -that w^as a bad vice!

It was Knudsen who advised me to burn charcoal and
sell it to the Indians of Nairobi, at a time when we wcre^ on
the farm, more than usually hard up. There were thou-



OUT OF AFRICA

sands of Rupees in it, he assured me. And it could not fail
under the aegis of Old Knudsen, for he had, at one time of
his tumultuous career, been to the utmost North of Sweden,
and there had learned the craft at his finger’s end. He took
upon himself to instruct the Natives in the art. While we
were thus working together in the wood I talked much
with Knudsen.

Charcoal-burning is a pleasant job. There is undoubtedly
something intoxicating about it, and it is known that charcoal-
burners see things in a different light from other people;
they are given to poetry and taradiddle, and wood-demons
come and keep them company. Charcoal is a beautiful thing
to turn out, when your kiln is burnt and opened up, and the
contents spread on the ground. Smooth as silk, matter defe-
cated, freed of weight and made imperishable, the dark ex-
perienced little mummy of the wood.

The mise-en-scene of the art of charcoal-burning is in it-
self as lovely as possible. As we were cutting down the
undergrowth only,— for charcoal cannot be made from thick
timber,— we were still working under the crowns of the tall
trees. In this stillness and shade of the African forest, the
cut wood smelt like gooseberries; and the piercing, fresh,
rank, sour smell of the btirning kiln was as bracing as a sea
breeze. The whole place had a theatrical atmosphere which,
under the Equator, where there are no theatres, was of in-
finite charm. The thin blue whirls of smoke from the kilns
arose at regular distances, and the dark kilns themselves
looked like tents on the stage; the place was a smugglers’ or
soldiers’ camp in a romantic Opera. The dark figures of the
Natives moved noiselessly amongst them. Where the under-
woods have been cleared away in an African forest you will
always get a great number of butterflies, which seem to like
to cluster on the stubs. It was all mysterious and innocent.



VISITORS TO THE FARM


In the surroundings, the small crooked form of Old Knud-
sen fitted in wonderfully well, flickering about, red-topped,
agile, now that he had got a favourite job to attend to,
sneering and encouraging, like a Puck grown old and blind
and very malicious. He was conscientious about his work
and surprisingly patient with his Native pupils. We did not
always agree. In Paris, where as a girl I went to a painting
school, I had learnt that olive-wood will make the best char-
coal, but Knudsen explained that olive had no knots in it,
and, seven thousand devils in Hell, every one knew that the
heart of things was in their knots.

A particular circumstance here in the wood soothed Knud-
sen’s hot temper. The African trees have a delicate foliage,
mostly digitate, so that when you have cleared away the
dense undergrowth, so to say hollowing out the forest, the
light is like the light in a beechwood in May at home, when
the leaves are just unfolded, or hardly unfolded yet. I drew
Knudsen’s attention to the likeness, and the idea pleased him,
for all the time of the charcoal-burning he kept up and de-
veloped a fantasy: we were on a Whitsunday picnic in
Denmark. An old hollow tree he christened Lottenburg,
after a place of amusement near Copenhagen. When I had
a fe^v bottles of Danish beer hidden in the depths of Lotten-
burg, and invited him to a drink there, he condescended to
think it a good joke.

When we had all our kilns lighted we sat down and talked
life. I learned much about Knudsen’s past life, and the
strange adventures that had fallen to him wherever he had
wandered. You had, in these conversations, to talk of Old
Knudsen himself, the one righteous man,— or you would
sink into that black pessimism against ^vhich he was warning
you. He had experienced many things: shipwrecks, plague,
fishes of unknown colouring, drinking-spouts, water-spouts,

189



OUT OF AFRICA

three contemporaneous suns in the sky, false friends, black
villainy, short successes, and showers of gold that instantly
dried up again. One strong feeling ran through his Odys-
sey: the abomination of the law, and all its works, and all its
doings. He was a born rebel, he saw a comrade in every
outlaw. A heroic deed meant to him in itself an act of defi-
ance against the law\ He liked to talk of kings and roya^
families, jugglers, dwarfs and lunatics, for them he took to
be outside the law,— and also of any crime, revolution, trick,
and prank, that flew in the face of the law. But for the goocf
citizen he had a deep contempt, and law-abidingness in any
man was to him the sign of a slavish mind. He did not even
respect, or believe in, the law of gravitation, which I learnt
while we were felling trees together: he saw no reason why
it should not be— by unprejudiced, enterprising people-
changed into the exact reverse.

Knudsen was eager to imprint on my mind the names of
people he had known, preferably of swindlers and scoun-
drels. But he never in his narrations mentioned the name of a
woman. It was as if time had swept his mind both of Elsi-
nore’s sweet girls, and of the merciless women of the harbour-
towns of the world. All the same, when I was talking with
him I felt in his life the constant presence of an unknown
woman. I cannot say who she may have been: wife, mother,
bchool-dame or wife of his first employer,— in my thoughts
I called her Madam Knudsen. I imagined her short because
he was so short himself. She was the woman who ruins th^
pleasure of man, and therein is always right. She was the
wife of the curtain-lectures, and the housewife of the big
cleaning-days, she stopped all enterprises, she washed the faces
of boySf and snatched away the man’s glass of gin from
the table before him, she was law and order embodied.
In her claim of absolute power she had some likeness to the-
190



VISITORS TO THE FARM

female deity of the Somali women, but ?\Iadani Knudsen did
not dream of enslaving by love, she ruled bv reasoning* and
righteousness. Knudscn must have met her at a youny a/^’C
when his mind was soft enough to receive an ineffaceable im-
pression. He had fled from her to the Sea, for the Sea she
loathes, and there she does not come, but ashore again in
Africa he had not escaped her, she was still with him. In his
wild heart, under his white-red hair, he feared her more
than he feared any man, and suspected all Women of being
in reality Madam Knudsen in disguise.

Our charcoal-burning in the end was no financial success.
From time to time it would happen that one of our kilns
caught fire, and there was our profit gone up in smoke.
Knudsen himself was much concerned about our failure,,
and speculated hard upon it, at last he declared that no-
body in the world could burn charcoal if they did not have
a fair supply of snow at hand.

Knudsen also helped me to make a pond on the farm. The
farm-road in one place ran through a wide cup of grassy
ground, there was a spring here and I thought out the plan
of building a dam below it and turning the place into a lake.
You are always short of water in Africa, it would be a great
gain to the cattle to be able to drink in the field, and save
themselves the long journey down to the river. This idea of
a dam occupied all the farm day and night, and was much
^^scussed; in the end, when it was finished, it was to all of
us a majestic achievement. It was two hundred feet long.
Old Knudsen took a great interest in it, and taught Pooran
Singh to fabricate a dam-scoop. We had trouble with the
dam when it was built, because it would not hold water
when, after a long dry period, the big rains began; it gave
way in a number of places and was half washed away more
than once. It was Knudsen who struck upon the scheme of


IQI



OUT OF AFRICA


Strengthening the earthwork by driving the farm oxen anc
the Squatters’ stock across the dam whenever they came tc
the pond to drink. Every goat and sheep had to contribute
to the great work and stamp the structure. He had some big
bloody fights with the little herdboys down here, for Knud-
sen insisted that the cattle should walk over slowly, but the
wild young Totos wanted them galloping across, tails in the
air. In the end, when I had sided with Knudsen and he had
got the better of the Totos, the long file of cattle, sedately
marching along the narrow bank looked against the sky like
Noah’s procession of animals going into the ark; and Old
Knudsen himself, counting them, his stick under his arm,
looked like the boatbuilder Noah, content in the thought
that everybody but himself was soon to drown.

In the course of time, I got a vast expanse of water here,
seven feet deep in places; the road went through the pond,
it was very pretty. Later on we even built two more dams
lower down and in this way obtained a row of ponds, like
pearls upon a string. The pond now became the heart of the
farm. It was always much alive, with a ring of cattle and
children round it, and in the hot season, when water-holes
dried up in the plains and the hills, the birds came to the
farm: herons, ibis, kingfishers, quail, and a dozen varieties
of geese and duck. In the evening, when the first stars
sprang out in the sky, I used to go and sit by the pond, and
then the birds came home. Swimming birds have a pufposCr.,
ful flight, unlike that of other birds: they are on a journey,
going from one place to another,— and what perspective is
there not in the reading wild swimmers! The duck con-
cluded their orbit over the glass-clear sky, to swoop noise-
lessly into the dark water like so many arrow-heads let off
backwards by a heavenly archer. I once shot a crocodile in
the pond, it was a strange thing, for he must have wandered
192

twelve miles from the Athi river to get there. How did he
know that there would be water now, where it had never
been before?

When the first pond was finished, Knudsen communi-
cated to me the plan of putting fish into it. We had in
Africa a kind of perch, which was good to eat, and we dwell
much upon the idea of rich fishing on the farm. It was not,
however, an easy thing to get them, the Game-Department
had set out perch in ponds but would let nobody fish there
yet. But Knudsen confided to me his knowledge of a pond
of which no one else in the world knew', w^here we could
get as many fish as we wanted. We would drive there, he
explained, draw a net through the pond, and take the fish
back in the car in tins and vats in which they would keep
alive on the way if we remembered to put water wveeds in
with the water. He w'as so keen on his scheme that he trem-
bled while developing it to me; with his own hands he made
one of his inimitable fishing-nets for it. But as the time for
the expedition drew near it took on a more and more mys-
terious aspect. It should be undertaken, he held, on a full
moon night, about midnight. At first w'e had meant to take
three boys with us, then he reduced the number to two and
.,tp-one, and kept asking whether he w^as absolutely trust-
worthy? In the end he declared that it would be better that
he and I should go by ourselves. I thought this a bad plan,
for we w^ould not be able to carry the tins into the car, but
Knudsen insisted that it would be by far the best, and added
that we ought to tell no one of it.

I had friends in the Game-Department, and I could not
help it, I had to ask him: ‘Ivnudsen, to w^hom do these fish
that we are going to catch, really belong?” Not a word an-
swered Knudsen. He spat, a regular old sailor’s spit,— stretched
out his foot in the old patched shoe and rubbed out the spit-

ting on the ground, turned on his heel and walked off deadly
slowly. He drew his head down between his shoulders as he
went, now he could no longer see at all, but was fumbling
before him with his stick, he was once more a beaten man,
a homeless fugitive in a low, cold world. And as if in his
gesture he had pronounced a spell I stood upon the spot
where he had left me, victorious, in Madam Knudsen’s slip-
pers.

The fishing project was never again approached between
Knudsen and me. Only some time after his death did I, with
the assistance of the Game Department, set perch into the
pond. They thrived there, and added their silent, cool, mute,
restive life to the other life of the pond. In the middle of
the day one could, on passing the pond, see them standing
near the surface, like fish made out of dark glass in the dim
sunny water. My Toto Tumbo was sent to the pond with a
primitive fishing-rod and drew up a perch of two pounds
whenever an unexpected guest arrived at the house.

When I had found old Knudsen dead on the farm-road, I
sent in a runner to the Police of Nairobi and reported his
death. I had meant to bury him on the farm, but late at
night two police officers came out in a car to fetch him, and
brought a coffin with them. In the meantime a thunderstorm,
had broken out, and we had had three inches of rain, for
this was just at the beginning of the long rainy season. We
drove down to his house through torrents and sheets of
water; as we carried Knudsen out to the car the thunder
roUed over our heads like cannons, and the flashes of light-
ning stood on all sides thick as ears in a cornfield. The car
had no chains to it and could hardly keep on the road, it
swung from one side of it to another. Old Knudsen would
have liked it, he would have been satisfied with his Exit from
the farm.

Afterwards I had a disagreement with the Nairobi Mu-

D

nicipality over his funeral arrangements, it developed into a
heated argument and I had to go into town about it more
than once. It was a legacy left to me by Knudsen, a last tilt,
by proxy, at the face of the law. Thus I xvas no longer
Madam Knudsen, but a brother.

There was one traveller who came to the farm, slept there
for one night, and walked off not to come back, of whom
I have since thought from time to time. His name was
Emmanuels on; he was a Swede and when I first knew
him he held the position of maitre d'hotel at one of the
hotels of Nairobi. He was a fattish young man with a red
puffed face, and he was in the habit of standing by my chair
when I was lunching at the hotel, to entertain me in a very
oUy voice of the old country, and of mutual acquaintances
there; he was so persistently conversational that after a while
I changed over to the only other hotel which in those days
we had in the town. I then only vaguely heard of Emman-
uelson; he seemed to have a gift for bringing himself into
trouble, and also to differ, in his tastes and ideas of the pleas-
ures of life, from the customary. So he had become un-
popular with the other Scandinavians of the country. Upon
one afternoon he suddenly appeared at the farm, much up-
set and frightened, and asked me for a loan so as to get off
to Tanganyika at once, as otherwise he believed he would
be sent to jail. Either my help came too late or Emmanuel-
son spent it on other things, for a short time after I heard
that he had been arrested in Nairobi, he did not go to prison
but for some time he disappeared from my horizon.

VISITORS TO THE FARM


One evening I came riding home so late that the stars
wtxt already out, and caught sight of a man waiting outside
my house on the stones. It was Emmanuelson and he an-
nounced himself to me in a cordial voice: ‘‘Here comes a
vagabond, Baroness.” I asked him how it was that I should
find him there, and he told me that he had lost his w^ay and
so been landed at my house. His way to where? To Tan-
ganyika.

That could hardly be true,— the Tanganyika road was the
great highway and easy to find, my own farm-road took off
from it. Hoav was he going to get to Tanganyika? I asked
him. He was going to walk, he informed me. That, I an-
swered, was not a possible thing to do for anyone, it would
mean three days through the Masai-Reserve without water,
and the lions were bad there just now, the Masai had been
in the same day to complain about them and had asked me
to come out and shoot one for them.

Yes, yes, Emmanuelson knew of all that, but he was going
to walk to Tanganyika all the same. For he did not know
what else to do. He was wondering now whether, having
lost his way, he could bear me company for dinner and
sleep at the farm to start early in the morning?— if that was
not convenient to me he would set out straight away while
the stars were out so bright,

I had remained sitting on my horse while I talked to him^
to accentuate that he was not a guest in the house, for I did
not want him in to dine with me. But as he spoke, I saw that
he did not expect to be invited either, he had no faith in my
hospitality or in his own power of persuasion, and he made
a lonely figure in the dark outside my house, a man without
a friend. His hearty manner was adapted to save not his own
face, which was past it, but mine, if now I sent him away it
would be no unkindness, but quite all right. This was cour-

tesy in a huntsed animal, caHtxi for my Sice to take the
pony, and got off,— “Come in, Emmanuelson,” I said, “you
can dine here and stay over the night-”

In the light of the lamp Emmanuelson was a sad sight.
He had on a long black overcoat such as nobody wears in
Africa, he was unshaven and his hair was not cut, his old
shoes were split at the toe. He was bringing no belongings
with him to Tanganyika, his hands were empty. It seemed
that I was to take the part of the High Priest who presents
the goat alive to the Lord, and sends it into the wilderness.
I thought that here we needed wine. Berkeley Cole, who
generally kept the house in wine, some time ago had sent
me a case of a very rare burgundy, and I now told Juma to
open a bottle from it. When w^e sat down for dinner and
Emmanuelson’s glass was filled he drank half of it, held it
towards the lamp and looked at it for a long time like a per-
son attentively listening to music. ^‘Fameux'' he said, ‘Jameiix;
this is a Chambertin 1906.” It was so, and that gave me re-
spect for Emmanuelson.

Otherwise he did not say much to begin with, and I did
not know what to say to him. I asked him how it was that
he had not been able to find any work at all. He answered
that it was because he knew nothing of the things with
which people out here occupied themselves. He had been
dismissed at the hotel, besides he was not really a maitre
d’hotel by profession.

“Do you know anything of book-keeping?” I asked him.

“No. Nothing at all,” he said, “I have always found it
very difficult to add two figures together.”

“Do you know about cattle at all?” I went on. “Cows?”
he asked. “No, no. I am afraid of cows.”

“Can you drive a tractor, then?” I asked. Here a faint ray
198



VISITORS TO THE FARM


of hope appeared on his face. “No/’ he said, “but I think
that I could learn that.”

“Not on my tractor though,’' I said, “but tel! me, Emman-
uelson, Avhat have you ever been doing? What are you in
lifer’'

Eniiiianuelson drew himself up straight. “'Wdiat am I?”
he exclaimed. “Why, I am an actor.”

I thought: Thank God, it is altogether outside my capac-
it\^ to assist this lost man in any practical way; the time has
come for general human conversation. “You are an actor?”
I said, “that is a fine thing to be. And which were vour
favourite parts when you were on the stage?”

“Oh I am a tragic actor,” said Emmanuelson, “mv favour-
ite parts were that of xYrmand in Ta Dame aux Camelias’
and of Oswald in ‘Ghosts’.”

We talked for some time of these plays, of the various
actors whom we had seen in them and of the wav in which
we thought that they should be acted. Emmanuelson looked
round the room. “You have not,” he asked, “by any chance
got the plays of Henrik Ibsen here? Then w^e might do the
last scene of ‘Ghosts’ together, if you would not mind tak-
ing the part of Mrs. Alving.”

“ ”1 had not got Ibsen’s plays.

“But perhaps you will remember it?” said Emmanuelson
warming to his plan. “I myself know Oswald by heart from
beginning to end. That last scene is the best. For a real
tragic effect, you know, that is impossible to beat.”

The stars were out and it was a very fine warm night,
there was not long, now, to the big rains. I asked Emman-
uelson if he did really mean to walk to Tanganyika.

“Yes,” he said, “I am going, now, to be my own prompter.”

“It is a good thing for you,” I said, “that you are not
married.”


199



OUT OF AFRICA

“Yes,” said he, “yes.” After a Kttle while he added mod-
estly: “I am married though.”

In the course of our talk, Emmanuelson complained of
the fact that out here a white man could not hold his own
against the competition from the Natives, who worked so
much cheaper. “Now in Paris,” he said, “I could always, for
a short time, get a job as a waiter in some cafe or other.”

“Why did you not stay in Paris, Emmanuelson?” I asked
him.

He gave me a swift clear glance. “Paris?” he said, “no, no,
indeed. I got out of Paris just at the nick of time.”

Emmanuelson had one friend in the world to whom in
the course of the evening he came back many times. If he
could only get in touch with him again, everything would
be different, for he was prosperous and very generous. This
man was a conjurer and was travelling all over the world.
When Emmanuelson had last heard of him he had been in
San Francisco.

From time to time we talked of literature and the theatre
and then again we would come back to Emmanuelson’s fu-
ture. He told me how his countrymen out here in Africa
had one after another turned him out.

“You are in a hard position, Emmanuelson,” I said, “I do
not know that I can think of anyone who is, in a way,
harder up against things than you are.”

“No, I think so myself,” he said. “But then there is one
thing of w^hich I have thought lately and of which perhaps
you have not thought: some person or other will have to be
in the worst position of all people.”

He had finished his bottle and pushed his glass a little
away from him. “This journey,” he said, “is a sort of gam-
ble to me, le rouge et le noir. I have a chance to get out oj
things, I may even be getting out of everything. On the
200



VISITORS TO THE FARM


ocher hand if I get to Tanganyika I may get into things.”

“I think you will get to Tanganyika,” I said, ‘‘you may
get a lift from one of the Indian lorries travelling on that
road.”

“Yes, but there are the lions,” said Emmanuelson, “and the
Masai.”

“Do you believe in God, Emmanuelson.-” I asked him.

“Yes, yes, yes,” said Emmanuelson. He sat in silence for a
time. “Perhaps you will think me a terrible sceptic,” he said,
“if I now say what I am going to say. But with the excep-
tion of God I believe in absolutely nothing whatever.”

“Look here, Emmanuelson,” I said, “have you got any
money

“Yes, I have,” he said, “eighty cents.”

“That is not enough,” I said, “and I myself have got no
money in the house. But perhaps Farah will have some.”
Farah had got four rupees.

Next morning, some time before sunrise, I told my boys
to wake up Emmanuelson and to make breakfast for us. I
had thought, in the course of the night, that I should like to
take him in my car for the first ten miles of his w^ay. It was
no advantage to Emmanuelson, who w^ouid still have another
eighty miles to walk, but I did not like to see him step
straight from the threshold of my house into his uncertain
fate, and besides I wished to be, myself, somew’-here within
this comedy or tragedy of his. I made him up a parcel of
sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs, and gave him with it a
bottle of the Chambertin 1906 since he appreciated it. I
thought that it might well be his last drink in life.

Emmanuelson in the dawn looked like one of those legend-
ary corpses whose beards grow quickly in the earth, but
he came forth from his grave with a good grace and was
very placid and well-balanced as we drove on. When we


201



OUT OF AFRICA

had come to the other side of the Mbagathi river, I let him
down from the car. The morning air was clear and there
was not a cloud in the sky. He was going towards the
South-West. As I looked round to the opposite horizon, the
sun just came up, dull and red: like the yolk of a hard-
boiled egg, I thought. In three or four hours she would be
white-hot, and fierce upon the head of the wanderer.

Emmanuelson said good-bye to me; he started to walk,
and then came back and said good-bye once more. I sat in
the car and watched him, and I think that as he went he was
pleased to have a spectator. I believe that the dramatic in-
stinct within him was so strong that he was at this moment
vividly aware of being leaving the stage, of disappearing, as
if he had, with the eyes of his audience, seen himself go.
Exit Emmanuelson. Should not the hills, the thorn-trees and
the dusty road take pity and for a second put on the aspect
of cardboard?

In the morning breeze his long black overcoat fluttered
round his legs, the neck of the bottle stuck up from one of
its pockets. I felt my heart filling with the love and grati-
tude which the people who stay at home are feeling for the
wayfarers and wanderers of the world, the sailors, explorers
and vagabonds. As he came to the top of the hill he turned,
took off his hat and waved it to me, his long hair was blown
up from his forehead.

Farah, who was with me in the car, asked me: “Where is
that Bwana going?” Farah called Emmanuelson a Bwana for
the sake of his own dignity, since he had slept in the house.

“To Tanganyika,” I said.

“On foot?” asked he.

“Yes,” I said.

“Allah be with him,” said Farah.

In the course of the day I thought much of Emmanuel-


202



VISITORS TO THE FARM


son, and went out of the house to look towards the Tangan-
yika road. In the night, about ten o’clock, I heard the roar
of a lion far awav to the South-West; half an hour Liter I
heard him again. I wondered if he was sitting upon an old
black overcoat. During the following w'eek I tried to get
news of Emmanuelson, and told Farah to ask his Indian ac-
quaintances who were running lorries to Tanganyika,
Aidiether any lorrv had passed or met him on the road. But
nobody knew anything of him.

Half a year later I was surprised to receive a registered
letter from Dodoma, where I knew no one. The letter was
from Emmanuelson. It contained the fifty rupees that I had
first lent him when he had been trying to get out of the
country, and Farah’s four rupees. Apart from this sum,—
the last money in all the world that I had expected to see
again,— Emmanuelson sent me a long, sensible and charming
letter. He had got a job as a bartender in Dodoma, whatever
kind of bar they may have there, and tvas getting on wxil.
He seemed to have in him a talent for gratitude, he remem-
bered everything of his evening on the farm, and came back
many times to the fact that there he had felt amongst
friends. He told me in detail about his journey to Tangan-
yika. He had much good to sav of the Masai. They had
found him on the road and had taken him in, had shown
him great kindness and hospitality, and had let him travel
with them most of the way, by many circuits. He had, he
wrote, entertained them so well, with recounts of his ad-
ventures in many countries, that they had not wanted to let
him go. Emmanuelson did not know any xMasai language,
and for his Odyssey he must have fallen back upon panto-
mime.

- It was fit and becoming, I thought, that Emmanuelson
should have sought refuge with the xMasai, and that they

103



OUT OF AFRICA

should have received him. The true aristocracy and the
true proletariat of the world are both in understanding with
tragedy. To them it is the fundamental principle of God,
and the key, —the minor key,— to existence. They differ in
this way from the bourgeoisie of all classes, who deny trag-
edy, who will not tolerate it, and to whom the word of
tragedy means in itself unpleasantness. Many misunderstand-
ings between the white middle-class immigrant settlers and
the Natives arise from this fact. The sulky Masai are both
aristocracy and proletariat, they would have recognized at
once in the lonely wanderer in black, a figure of tragedy*
and the tragic actor had come, with them, into his own.

The \4sits of my friends to the farm were happy events in
my life, and the farm knew it.

men one of Denys Finch-Hatton’s long Safaris xvas
drawing to its end, it happened that I would find, on a
morning, a young Masai standing upon one long slim leg
outside my house. “Bedar is on his way back,” he announced.
“He. will be here in two or three days.”

In the afternoon, a Squatter Toto from the outskirts of
the farm sat and waited on the lawn, to tell me, when I
came out. There is a flight of Guinea-fowd down by the
bend of the river. If you want to shoot them for Bedar
when he comes I will come out with you at sunset to show
you where to find them.”

To the great wanderers amongst my friends, the farm
owed its charm, I believe, to the fact that it was stationary
and remained the same whenever they came to it. They had
been over vast countries and had raised and broken their
tents m many places, now they were pleased to round my
drive that was steadfast as the orbit of a star. They liked to
be met by familiar faces, and I had the same servants all the
time that I was in Africa. I had been on the farm longing to
get away, and they came back to it longing for books and

linen sheets and the cool atmosphere in a big shuttered
room; by their campfires they had been meditating upon
the joys of farm life, and as they arrived they asked me
eagerly: “Have you taught your cook to make an omelette
a la chasseur?— ond have the gramophone records from Te-
trouchka’ arrived by the last mail?” They came and stayed
in the house also when I was away, and Denys had the use
of it, when I was on a visit in Europe. “My Silvan Retreat,”
Berkeley Cole called it.

In return for the goods of civilization, the wayfarers
brought me trophies from their hunts: Leopard and Chee-
tah skins, to be made into fur coats in Paris, snake and lizard
skins for shoes, and marabout feathers.

To please them I experimented, while they were away,
with many curious recipes out of old cookery books, and
worked to make European flowers grow in my garden.

Once, when I was at home, an old lady in Denmark gave
me twelve fine peony-bulbs which I brought into the coun-
try with me at some trouble, as the import regulations about
plants were strict. When I had them planted, they sent up,
almost immediately, a great number of dark carmoisin curvi-
linear shoots, and later a lot of delicate leaves and rounded
buds. The first flower which unfolded was called Duchesse
de Nemours^ it was a large single white peony, -very noble
and rich, it gave out a profusion of fresh sweet scent. When
I cut it and put it in water in my sitting-room, every single
white person entering the room stopped and remarked upon
it. Why, it was a peony! But soon after this, all the other
buds of my plants withered and fell off, and I never got
more than that one flower.

Some years later I talked with the English gardener of
Lady McMillan, of Chiromo, about peonies. “We have not
^nicceeded in growing peonies in Africa,” he said, “and shall
106



V1S1TOP.S TO THE FARM


not do so till we manage to make an imported bulb jflowei
here, and can take the seed from that flower. This is how
we got Delphinium into the Colony.” In that way I might
have introduced peonies into the country and made my
name immortal like the Duchesse de Nemours herself; and
I had ruined the glory of the future by picking my unique
flower and putting it in water. I have very often dreamed
that I have seen the white peony growing, and I have re-
joiced because after all I had not cut it off.

Friends from farms up country, and from the town, ar-
rived at the house. Hugh Martin, of the Land Office, came
out from Nairobi to entertain me; a brilliant person, versed
in the rare literature of the world, who had passed his life
peacefully in the Civil Service of the East, and there, amongst
other things, had developed an innate talent for looking like
an immensely fat Chinese Idol. He called me Candide, and
was himself a curious Doctor Pangloss of the farm, firmly
and placidly rooted in his conviction of the meanness and
contemptibleness of human nature and of the Universe, and
content in his faith, for why should it not be so? He hardly
ever moved out of the large chair in which he had once
placed himself. With his bottle and glass before him, and a
sedately beaming face, he there spread and expanded upon
his theories of life, luminating with ideas, like some fantas-
tical quick phosphoric growth of matter and thought, a fat
man at peace with the world and resting in the Devil, with
the stamp of cleanliness upon him that the Devil’s disciples
bear, in preference to many of those of the Lord.

Young, big-nosed Gustav Mohr from Norway, of an eve-
ning suddenly swooped on the house from the farm he man-
aged, on the other side of Nairobi. He was a rousing farmer
and helped me in the work of the farm in word and deed,

207



OUT OF AFRICA

more than any other man in the country,— with a simpk
vigorous readiness as if it were standing to reason that farm-
ers, or Scandinavians, were to slave for one another.

Here he was now flung on to the farm by his own burn-
ing mind, like a stone out of a volcano. He was going mad,
he said, in a country which expected a man to keep alive on
talk of oxen and sisal, his soul was starving and he could
stand it no longer. He began the moment he came into the
room and went on till after midnight, holding forth on love,
communism, prostitution, Hamsun, the Bible, and poisoning
himself in very bad tobacco all the time. He would hardly
eat, he would not listen, if I tried to get a word in he
shrieked, glowing with the fire within him, and butting the
air with his wild light head. He had much in him to rid him-
self of, and was generating more as he spoke. Suddenly, at
two o’clock at night, he had no more to say. He would then
sit peacefully for a little while, a humble look on his face,
like a convalescent in a hospital garden, get up, and drive
away at a terrible speed, prepared to keep alive, once more,
for a while, on sisal and oxen.

Ingrid Lindstrom came to stay on the farm when she
could get away for a day or two from her own farm, her
turkeys and market-gardening at Njoro. Ingrid was as fair
of skin as of mind, and the daughter and wife of Swedish
officers. She and her husband had come out with their chil-
dren to Africa on a joyous adventure, a picnic, to make a
fortune quickly, and had bought up flax-land because at that
time flax was £ 500 a ton, and when, just after that, flax fell
to and flax-land and flax-machinery were worth noth-
ing, she put in all her strength to save the farm for her fam-
ily, planning her poultry farm and her market garden, and
working like a slave. In the course of that strife she fell
deeply in love with the farm, with her cows and pigs, Na-
208



VISITORS TO THE FARM


tives and vegetables, with the very soil of her bit of Africa,
in such a great desperate passion that she would have sold
both husband and children to keep it. She and I, during the
bad years, had wept in one another’s arms at the thought of
losing our land. It was a joyful time when Ingrid came to
stay with me, for she had all the broad bold insinuating jovi-
ality of an old Swedish peasant woman, and in her weather-
beaten face, the strong w^hite teeth of a laughing Valkyrie.
Therefore does the world love the Swedes, because in the
midst of their woes they can draw it all to their bosom and
be so gallant that they shine a long way away.

Ingrid had an old Kikuyu cook and houseboy named Ke-
mosa, who filled a number of offices with her, and looked
upon all her activities as his own. He slaved for her in the
market-garden and poultry-yard, and also acted as a Duenna
to her three small daughters, travelling with them to and
from their boarding school. When I came up to visit her on
her farm at Njoro, Ingrid told me, Kemosa lost all his bal-
ance of mind, let go his hold of everything else, and made
the grandest possible preparations for my reception, killing
off her turkeys, so much was he impressed with Farah’s
greatness. Ingrid said he looked upon his acquaintance with
Farah as upon the greatest honour of his existence.

Mrs. Darrell Thompson of Njoro, whom I hardly knew,
came out to see me when the doctors had informed her that
she had only got a few more months to live. She told me
that she had just been buying a pony in Ireland, a prize-
jumper,— for horses were to her, in death as in life, the
height and glory of existence,— and that now, after she had
talked with the doctors, she had at first meant to cable home
to stop him from coming out, but then she had made up her
mind to leave him to me when she herself should die. I did
not think much about it until, after her death half a year

209



OUT OF AFRICA

later, the pony, Poor-box, made his appearance at Ngong.
Poor-box when he came to live with us, proved himself the
most intelligent being on the farm. He was not much to
look at, stumpy and long past his youth, Denys Finch-Hatton
used to ride him, but I never cared much to do so. But by
pure politics and circumspection, by knowing exactly what
he wanted to do, amongst the young shining fiery horses
brought out for the occasion by our wealthiest people of
the Colony, he won the jumping competition of Kabete,
which was held in honour of the Prince of Wales. With his
usual collected unassuming mien and countenance he brought
home a big silver medal and, after a week of extreme anxiety,
raised great radiant waves of rapture and triumph in my
household and on all the farm. He died from horse-sickness,
six months later, and was buried outside his stable under the
lemon trees, and much lamented; his name lived a long time
after him.

Old Mr. Bulpett, whom the Club called Uncle Charles,
used to come out to dine with me. He was a great friend of
mine, and a kind of ideal to me, the English gentleman of
the Victorian age, and quite at home in our own. He had
swum the Hellespont, and had been one of the first to climb
the Matterhorn, and he had been, in his early youth, in the
’eighties perhaps. La Belle Otero’s lover. I was told that she
had ruined him altogether and let him go. It was to me as
if I were sitting down to dinner with Armand Duval or the
Chevalier des Grieux themselves. He had many lovely pic-
tures of Otero, and lilced to talk about her.

Once, at dinner at Ngong, I said to him: “I see that La
Belle Otero’s memoirs have been published. Are you in
them?”

“Yes,” he said, “I am in them. Under another name, but
still there.”


210



VISITORS TO THE FARM


“What does she write about you?” I asked.

“She writes,” he said, “that I was a young man who went
through a hundred thousand for her sake within six months^
but that I had full value for my money.”

“And do you consider,” I said and laughed, “that you did
have full value?”

He thought my question over for a very short moment.
“Yes,” he said. “Yes, I had.”

Denys Finch-Hatton and I went with Mr. Bulpett for a
picnic to the top of the Ngong Hills on his seventy-seventh
birthday. As we sat up there we came to discuss the ques-
tion of whether, if we were offered a pair of real wings,
which could never be laid off, we would accept or decline
the offer.

Old Mr. Bulpett sat and looked out over the tremendous
big country below us, the green land of Ngong, and the
Rift Valley to the West, as if ready to fly off over it at any
moment. “I would accept,” he said, “I would certainly ac-
cept. There is nothing I should like better.” After a little
time of thought he added: “I suppose that I should think it
over, though, if I were a lady.”


21 r






As far as Berkeley Cole and Denys Finch-Hatton were
concerned, my house was a communist establishment.
Everything in it was theirs, and they took a pride in it, and
brought home the things they felt to be lacking. They kept
the house up to a high standard in wine and tobacco, and
got books and gramophone records out from Europe for
me. Berkeley arrived with his car loaded up with turkeys,
eggs, and oranges, from his own farm on Mount Kenya.
They both had the ambition to make me a judge of wine,
as they were, and spent much time and thought in the task.
They took the greatest pleasure in my Danish table glass
and china, and used to build up on the dinner table a tall
shining pyramid of all my glass, the one piece on the top of
the other; they enjoyed the sight of it.

Berkeley, when he stayed on the farm, had a bottle of
champagne out in the forest every morning at eleven o’clock.
Once, as he was taking leave of me, and thanking me for his
time on the farm, he added that there had been one shadow
in the picture, for we had been given coarse and vulgar
glasses for our wine under the trees. “I know, Berkeley,” I
said, “but I have so few of my good glasses left, and the
boys will break them when they have to carry them such a
212



VISITORS TO THE FARM


long way.’’ He looked at me gravely, my hand in his. “But
my dear,” he said, “it has been so sad.” So afterwards he had
my best glasses brought out in the wood.

It was a curious thing about Berkeley and Denys,— who
were so deeply regretted by their friends in England when
they emigrated, and so much beloved and admired in the
Colony,— that they should be all the same, outcasts. It was
not a society that had thrown them out, and not any place
in the whole world either, but time had done it, they did
not belong to their century. No other nation than the Eng-
lish could have produced them, but they were examples of
atavism, and theirs was an earlier England, a world which
no longer existed. In the present epoch they had no home,
but had got to wander here and there, and in the course of
time they also came to the farm. Of this they were not them-
selves aware. They had, on the contrary, a feeling of guilt
towards their existence in England which they had left, as
if, just because they were bored with it, they had been run-
ning away from a duty with which their friends had put
up. Denys, when he came to talk of his young days,— al-
though he was so young still,— and of his prospects, and the
advice that his friends in England sent him, quoted Shake-
speare’s Jaques:

“If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass.

Leaving his wealth and ease
A stubborn will to please . .

But he was wrong in his view of himself, so was Berkeley,
and so perhaps was Jaques. They believed that they were
deserters, who sometimes had to pay for their wilfulness,

but they were in reality exiles, who bore their exile with a
good grace.

Berkeley, if he had had his small head enriched with a
wig of long silky curls, could have walked in and out of the
Court of King Charles IL He might have sat, a nimble youth
from England, at the feet of the aged d’Artagnan, the d’Ar-
tagnan of Vingt Ans Apres, have listened to his wisdom,
and kept the sayings in his heart. I felt that the law of gravi-
tation did not apply to Berkeley, but that he might, as we
sat talking at night by the fire, at any moment go straight
up through the chimney. He was a very good judge of men,
with no illusions about them and no spite. Out of a land of
devilry, he was most charming to the people of whom he
had the poorest opinion. When he really chalked his soles
for the job he was an inimitable buffoon. But to be a wit in
the manner of Congreve and Wycherley en plain vingtieme
siecle takes a few more qualities than Congreve or Wycher-
ley themselves had got in them: a glow, grandezza, the wild
hope. Where the jest was carried far in its daring and arro-
gance, sometimes it became pathetic. When Berkeley, a lit-
tle heated, and as if translucent with wine, really got on his
high horse, on the wall behind him the shadow of it began
to grow and move, falling into a haughty and fantastical
canter, as if it came of a noble breed and its sire’s name had
been Rosinante. But Berkeley himself, the invincible jester,
lonely in his African life, half an invalid,— for his heart al-
ways gave him trouble,— with his beloved farm on Mount
Kenya every day more in the hands of the Banks, would
have been the last to recognize or, fear the shadow.

Small, very slight, red-haired, with narrow hands and
feet, Berkeley carried himself extremely erect, with a little
d’Artagnanesque turn of the head to right and left, the gentle
motion of the unbeaten duellist. He walked as noiselessly as

a cat. And, like a cat, he made every room that he sat in, a
place of comfort, as if he had had in him a source of heat
and fun. If Berkeley had come and sat with you upon the
smoking ruin of your house, he would, like a cat, have made
you feel that you were in a picked snug corner. When he
was at his ease you expected to hear him purr, like a big cat,
and when he was sick, it was more than sad and distressing,
it was formidable as is the sickness of a cat. He had no prin-
ciples, but a surprising stock of prejudices, as you would
expect it in a cat.

If Berkeley were a cavalier of the Stuarts’ day, Denys
should be set in an earlier English landscape, in the days of
Queen Elizabeth. He could have walked arm in arm, there,
with Sir Philip, or Francis Drake. And the people of Eliza-
beth’s time might have held him dear because to them he
would have suggested that Antiquity, the Athens, of which
they dreamed and wrote, Denys could indeed have been
placed harmoniously in any period of our civilization, tout
comme chez soi, all up till the opening of the nineteenth cen-
tury. He would have cut a figure in any age, for he was an
athlete, a musician, a lover of art and a fine sportsman. He
did cut a figure in his own age, but it did not quite fit in
anywhere. His friends in England always wanted him to
come back, they wrote out plans and schemes for a career
for him there, but Africa was keeping him.

The particular, instinctive attachment which all Natives
of Africa felt towards Berkeley and Denys, and towards a
few other people of their kind, made me reflect that per-
haps the white men of the past, indeed of any past, would
have been in better understanding and sympathy with the
coloured races than we, of our Industrial Age, shall ever
be. When the first steam engine was constructed, the roads

215



OUT OF AFRICA

of the races of the world parted, and we have never found
one another *since.

There was a shadow cast over my friendship with Berke-
ley by the circumstance that Jama, his young Somali serv-
ant, was of a tribe at war with Farah’s tribe. To people
familiar with the clannish feelings of the Somali, those dark
deep desert glances that were exchanged over our dinner
table, when the two were waiting on Berkeley and me, bode
as ill as possible. Late in the evening we fell to talking of
what we were to do when we should be coming out in the
morning to find both Farah and Jama cold, with daggers in
their hearts. In these matters the enemies knew neither fear
nor sense, they were held back from bloodshed and ruin
solely by their feelings of attachment, such as they were,
for Berkeley and me.

“I dare not,” said Berkeley, “tell Jama to-night that I have
changed my mind, and that I shall not this time be going to
Eldoret, where lives the young woman that he is in love
with. For then his heart will turn to stone against me, it will
be a matter of no importance to him if my clothes are
brushed, and he will go out and kill Farah.”

Jama’s heart, however, never did turn to stone towards
Berkeley. He had been with him a long time, and Berkeley
often talked about him. He told me how once, over a mat-
ter in which Jama held himself to be right, Berkeley had
lost his temper and had hit the Somali. “But then, my dear,
you know,” said Berkeley, “at the very same moment I
had one straight back in my face.”

“And how did it go then?” I asked him.

“Oh it went all right,” Berkeley said, modestly. After a
little while he added: “It was not so bad. He is twenty years
younger than me.”

This incident had left no trace in the attitude of either the
216



VISITORS TO THE FARM


master or the servant, Jama had a quiet, slightly patronizing
manner towards Berkeley, such as most Somali servants have
got towards their employers. After Berkeley’s death, Jama
did not want to stay in the country, but went back to Somali-
land.

Berkeley had a great, ever unsatisfied, love of the Sea. It
was a favourite dream of his that he and I should, —when we
had made money,— buy a dhow and go trading to Lamu,
Mombasa and Zanzibar. We had our plans all worked out
and our crew ready, but we never did make money.

Whenever Berkeley was tired or unwell he fell back on
his thoughts of the Sea. He then grieved over his own fool-
ishness in having spent a lifetime anywhere but on salt
water, and used strong language about it. Once when I was
going to Europe and he was in this mood, to please him I
conceived the plan of bringing out two ships’ lanterns, star-
board and port, to hang by the entrance door of my house,
and told him of it.

“Yes, it would be nice,” he said, “the house would be in
that way like a ship. But they must have sailed.”

,So in Copenhagen in a sailors’ shop by one of the old
Canals, I bought a pair of big old heavy ships’ lanterns, which
had for many years sailed in the Baltic. We had them up on
each side of the door, it faced East and we were pleased to
think that the lamps were correctly placed; as the earth, on
her course through the ether, throws herself forward, there
would be no collision. These lamps gave Berkeley much
content of heart. He often used to come to the house quite
late, and ordinarily at a great speed, but w^hen the lamps
were lighted he drove slowly, slowly, up the drive, to let
the little red and green stars in the night sink into his soul
and bring back old pictures, reminiscences of ship-faring, to
feel as if he were indeed approaching a silent ship on dark

water. We developed a signalling system in regard to the
lamps, changing their place or taking down the one, so that
he should know, already while in the forest, in what mood
he would find his hostess, and what sort of dinner was await-
ing him.

Berkeley, like his brother Galbraith Cole and his brother-
in-law Lord Delamere, was an early settler, a pioneer of the
Colony, and intimate with the Masai, who in those days
were the domineering nation of the land. He had known
them before the European civilization,— which in the depths
of their hearts they loathed more than anything else in the
world,— cut through their roots; before they were moved
from their fair North country. He could speak with them
of the old days in their own tongue. Whenever Berkeley
was staying on the farm, the Masai came over the river to
see him. The old chiefs sat and discussed their troubles of
the present time with him, his jokes would make them laugh,
and it was as if a hard stone had laughed.

Because of Berkeley’s knowledge of, and friendship with,
the Masai, a most imposing ceremony came to take place on
the farm.

When the Great War first broke out, and the Masai
had news of it, the blood of the old fighting tribe was all
up. They had visions of splendid battles and massacres, and
they saw the glory of the past returning once more. I hap-
pened to be out, during the first months of the war, alone
with Natives and Somali, with three ox-waggons, doing
transport for the English Government, and trekking through
the Masai Reserve. Whenever the people of a new district
heard of my arrival they came round to my camp, with
shining eyes, to ask me a hundred questions of the war
and the Germans,— was it true that they were coming from
218



//5/TORS TO THE FARM


the air? In their minds they were running breathless, to
meet danger and death. At night the young warriors
swarmed round my tent, in full war-paint, with spears and
swords; sometimes, in order to show me what they were
really like, they would give out a short roar, an imitation
of the lion’s roar. They did not doubt then that they would
be allowed to fight.

But the English Government did not think it wise to
organize the Masai to make war on white men, be they
even Germans, and it forbade the Masai to fight, and put
an end to all their hopes. The Kikuyu were to take part in
the war as carriers, but the Masai were to keep their hands
off their weapons. But in 1918, when conscription had been
introduced in regard to all the other Natives of the Colony,
the Government thought it necessary to call out the Masai
as well. An officer of the K.A.R., with his regiment, was
sent to Narok to procure three hundred Morani as soldiers.
By this time the Masai had lost their sympathy with the
war and refused to come. The Morani of the district dis-
appeared into the woods and the bush. In the pursuit of
them the K.A.R. troops by mistake fired on a manyatta,
and two old women were killed. Two days after, the Masai
Reserve was in open revolt, swarms of Morani swept
through the country, killed a number of Indian traders, and
burned down more than fifty dukhas. The situation was
serious, and the Government did not want to force it. Lord
Delamere was sent down to negotiate with the Masai and
in the end a compromise was set up. The Masai were al-
lowed to take out the three hundred Morani themselves,
and they were let off with a joint fine in punishment of
their devastation in the Reserve. No Morani appeared, but
by that time the Armistice put an end to the whole matter.

During the time of all these events, some of the old big

219



OUT OF AFRICA

Masai chiefs had made themselves useful to the English
military, by sending out their young men to scout on the
movements of the Germans in the Reserve and on the bor-
der. Now that the war was over, the Government wanted
to show their recognition of their services. A number of
medals were sent out from home to be distributed amongst
the Masai, and as far as twelve of the medals were con-
cerned Berkeley, who knew the Masai so well and could
speak Masai, was asked to deal them out.

My farm bordered on the Masai Reserve and Berkeley
came to ask me if he might stay with me and give out the
medals from my house. He was a little nervous about the
enterprise, and told me that he had no clear idea what was
expected from him. On a Sunday we drove together a long
way down into the Reserve, and talked with the people in
the manyattas, in order to summon the chiefs in question
to the farm on such and such a day. Berkeley in his very
young days had been an officer in the pth Lancers, and
he was then, I have been told, the smartest young officer in
his regiment. Still, as, towards sunset, we were driving home
again, he began to speak to me of the military calling and
mentality, and to develop his ideas upon them, in the manner
of a civilian.

The distribution of the medals, although in itself of no
special consequence, was an event of great dimensions and
weight. So much wisdom, sagacity and tact were displayed
in it, on both sides, as to make it stand for an act in the
history of the world, or a symbol:

. . His Darkness and his Brightness
exchanged a greeting of extreme politeness.”

The old Masai had arrived, followed by retainers or sons

VISITORS TO THE FARM


of theirs. They sat and waited on the lawn, from time to
time discussing my cows grazing there, perhaps they had
a faint hope that, in reward of their services, they were to
be made a present of a cow. Berkeley kept them waiting a
long time, which was, I believe, to them in the order of
things, in the meantime he had an armchair carried out on
the lawn in front of the house, in which to sit while he
gave out the medals. When in the end he came forth from
the house he looked, in this dark company, very fair, red-
haired and light-eyed. He had now the complete brisk
cheerful carriage and expression of an efficient young of-
ficer, so that I learned that Berkeley, who could let his face
express so many things, could also in the hour of need, make
it an absolute blank. He was followed by Jama, who had
on a very fine Arabian waistcoat all embroidered in gold
and silver, which Berkeley had let him buy for the occa-
sion, and who carried the box with the medals.

Berkeley stood up in front of his chair to speak, and so
active was the uprightness of his slight small figure that
the old people got on to their legs, one by one, and stood
facing him, their eyes in his, gravely. What the speech was
about I cannot say, as it was in Masai. It sounded as if he
were briefly informing the Masai that an unbelievable bene-
fit was to be bestowed upon them, and that the explanation
of the happenings was their own incredibly praisew^orthy
behaviour. But seeing that it was Berkeley who spoke, and
that from the faces of the Masai you would never learn
anything, it may have contained something quite different^
of which I should never have thought. When he had
spoken, without a moment’s pause he let Jama bring up the
box, and took out the medals, solemnly reading out, one
after another, the names of the Masai chiefs, and handing
them their medals with a generously outstretched arm. The


221



our OF AFRICA

Masai took them from him very silently, in an outstretched
hand. The ceremony could only have been carried through
so well by two parties of noble blood and great family
traditions; may democracy take no offence.

A medal is an inconvenient thing to give to a naked
man, because he has got no place to fix it on to, and the
old Masai chiefs kept standing with theirs in their hand.
After a time a very old man came up to me, held out his
hand with the medal in it and asked me to tell him what
it had got on it. I explained it to him as well as I could. The
silver coin had on the one side a head of Britannia, and
upon the other side the words: The Great War -for Civiliza-
tion.

I have later told some English friends of the incident of
the medals, and they have asked: “Why was not the King’s
head on the medals? It was a great mistake.” I myself do
not think so, it seems to me that the medals should not be
made too attractive, and that the whole matter was well
arranged. It may still be that it is this sort of thing which
we shall be given at the time when our reward is great in
heaven.

When Berkeley was taken ill, I was about to go to
Europe on a holiday. He was then a member of the Legis-
lative Council of the Colony, and I telegraphed to him:
“Will you not come and stay at Ngong for the sitting of
the council bring bottles.” He wired back: “Your telegram
straight from heaven arriving with bottles.” But when he
came to the farm, his car all filled up with wine, he did not
care to drink it. He was very pale, and even sometimes
quite silent. His heart was bad, and he could not do without
Jama, who had been taught to give him the injections for
it, and he had many worries that lay on it heavily; he lived
222



VISITORS TO THE FARM


in great fear of losing his farm. Still, by his presence, he
turned my house into a chosen, comfortable corner of the
world.

“I have come to the stage, Tania,” he said to me gravely,
“when I can only drive in the very best of cars, only smoke
the finest cigars and only drink the most exquisite vintages
of wine.” While he was staying with me then, he told me
one evening that the* doctor had ordered him to go to bed
and stay in bed for a month. I said to him that if he would
follow the order, and stay in bed for a month at Ngong, I
would give up my journey to remain there and look after
him, and go to Europe next year. He thought my offer
over for a little while. “My dear,” he said, “I could not do
it. If I did it to please you, what should I be afterwards.^”

I said good-bye to him then with a heavy heart. While I
was sailing home, past Lamu and Takaunga, where our
dhow was to have found her way, I thought of him. But
in Paris I heard that he had died. He had dropped down
dead before his house, as he was stepping out of the car.
He was buried on his farm, where he wished to be.

When Berkeley died, the country changed. His friends
felt it at the time, with great sadness, and many people came
to feel it later. An epoch in the history of the Colony
came to an end with him. In the course of the years many
things were reckoned from this turning point, and people
said: “When Berkeley Cole lived” or “Since Berkeley died.”
Up till his death the country had been the Happy Hunting
Grounds, now it was slowly changing and turning into a
business proposition. Some standards were lowered when
he went; a standard of wit, as it was soon felt,— and such
a thing is sad in a colony; a standard of gallantry,— soon
after his death people began to talk of their troubles; a
standard of humanity.

As Berkeley went away, a grim figure made her entrance
upon the stage from the opposite wing ,— dure necessite
maitresse des hou'mes et des dieux. It was a strange thing
that a small slight man should have been able to keep her
from the door, for so long a time as he drew breath. The
yeast was out of the bread of the land. A presence of grace-
fulness, gaiety and freedom, an electric power-factor was
out. A cat had got up and left the room.



8 VV»t-Mi^S


Denys Finch-Hatton had no other home in Africa than
the farm, he lived in my house between his Safaris, and
kept his books and his gramophone there. When he came
back to the farm, it gave out what was in it; it spoke,
—as the coffee-plantations speak, when with the first showers
of the rainy season they flower, dripping wet, a cloud of
chalk. When I was expecting Denys back, and heard his

car coming up the drive, I heard, at the same time, the

things of the farm all telling what they really were. He

was happy on the farm; he camfe there only when he

wanted to come, and it knew, in him, a quality of which
the world besides was not aware, a humility. He never did
but what he wanted to do, neither was guile found in his
mouth.

Denys had a trait of character which to me was very
precious, he liked to hear a story told. For I have always
thought that I might have cut a figure at the time of the
plague of Florence. Fashions have changed, and the art of
listening to a narrative has been lost in Europe. The Natives
of Africa, who cannot read, have still got it; if you begin
to them: “There was a man who walked out on the p lain,
and there he met another man,” you have them all with

225



OUT OF AFRICA

you, their minds running upon the unknown track of the
men on the plain. But white people, even if they feel that
they ought to, cannot listen to a recital. If they do not be-
come fidgety, and remember things that -should be done at
once, they fall asleep. The same people will ask you for
something to read, and may then sit all through an evening
absorbed in any kind of print handed them, they will even
then read a speech. They have been accustomed to take in
their impressions by the eye.

Denys, who lived much by the ear, preferred hearing a
tale told, to reading it; when he came to the farm he would
ask: “Have you got a story?” I had been making up many
while he had been away. In the evenings he made himself
comfortable, spreading cushions like a couch in front of
the fire, and with me sitting on the floor, cross-legged like
Scheherazade herself, he would listen, clear-eyed, to a long
tale, from when it began until it ended. He kept better ac-
count of it than I did myself, and at the dramatic appear-
ance of one of the characters, would stop me to say: “That
man died in the beginning of the story, but never mind.”

Denys taught me Latin, and to read the Bible, and the
Greek poets. He himself knew great parts of the Old Testa-
ment by heart, and carried the Bible with him on all his
journeys, which gained him the high esteem of the Mo-
hammedans.

He also gave me my gramophone. It was a delight to my
heart, it brought a new Ufe to the farm, it became the
voice of the farm.— “The soul within a glade the nightin-
gale is.”— Sometimes Denys would arrive unexpectedly at
the house, while I was out in the coffee-field or the maize-
field, bringing new records with him; he would set the
gramophone going, and as I came riding back at sunset,
the melody streaming towards me in the clear cool air of
226



VISITORS TO THE FARM


the evening would announce his presence to me, as if he
had been laughing at me, as he often did. The Natives
liked the gramophone, and used to stand round the house
to listen to it; some of my house-boys picked out a favourite
tune and asked me for it, when I was alone with them in
the house. It was a curious thing that Kamante should stick,
in his preference, with much devotion to the Adagio of
Beethoven’s Piano Concerto in G-Major; the first time that
he asked me for it he had some difficulty in describing it,
so as to make clear to me which tune it was that he wanted.

Denys and I, however, did not agree in our tastes. For
I wanted the old composers, and Denys, as if courteously
making up to the age for his lack of harmony with it, was
as modern as possible in his taste of all arts. He liked to
hear the most advanced music. “I would like Beethoven
all right,” he said, ‘'if he were not vulgar.”

Denys and I, whenever we were together, had great luck
with lions. Sometimes he came back from a shooting Safari
of two or three months, vexed that he had been unable to
get a good lion for the people from Europe whom he had
taken out. In the meantime the Masai had been to my house
and had asked me to come out and shoot a certain lion or
lioness which was killing off their cattle, and Farah and I
had been out, camping in their manyatta, sitting up over a
kill, or walking out in the early morning, without as much
as finding the track of a lion. But when Denys and I went
for a ride, the lions of the plains would be about, as in
attendance, we would come upon them then there at a meal,
or see them crossing the dry river-beds.

On a New Year’s morning, before sunrise, Denys and I
found ourselves on the new Narok Road, driving along as
fast as we could go on a rough road.


227



OUT OF AFRICA

Denys, the day before, had lent a heavy rifle to a friend
of his who was going South with a shooting party, and late
in the night he remembered that he had neglected to ex-
plain to him a certain trick in the rifle, by which the hair-
trigger might be put out of action. He was worried about
it and afraid that the hunter would come to some sort of
harm by his ignorance. We could then think of no better
remedy than that we should start as early as possible, take
the new road and try to overtake the shooting party at
Narok. It was sixty miles, through some rough country;
the Safari was travelling by the old road and would be
going slowly as it had heavy loaded lorries with it. Our
only trouble was that we did not know if the new road
would have been brought through all the way to Narok.

The early morning air of the African highlands is of
such a tangible coldness and freshness that time after time
the same fancy there comes back to you: you are not on
earth but in dark deep waters, going ahead along the bottom
of the sea. It is not even certain that you are moving at all,
the flows of chilliness against your face may be the deep-
sea currents, and your car, like some sluggish electric fish,
may be sitting steadily upon the bottom of the Sea, staring
in front of her with the glaring eyes of her lamps, and
letting the submarine life pass by her. The stars are so large
because they are no real stars but reflections, shimmering
upon the surface of the water. Alongside your path on the
sea-bottom, live things, darker than their surroundings, keep
on appearing, jumping up and sweeping into the long grass,
as crabs and beach-fleas will make their way into the sand.
The light gets clearer, and, about sunrise, the sea-bottom
lifts itself towards the surface, a new created island. Whirls
of smells drift quickly past you, fresh rank smells of the
228



VISITORS TO THE FARM


oKve-bushes, the brine scent of burnt grass, a sudden quell-
ing smell of decay.

Kanuthia, Denys’s boy, who sat in the back of the box-,
body car, gently touched my shoulder and pointed to the
right. To the side of the road, twelve or fifteen yards away
from it, was a dark bulk, a Manatee taking a rest on the
sands, and on the top of it something was stirring in the dark
water. It was, I saw later, a big dead Giraffe bull, that had
been shot two or three days before. You are not allowed to
shoot the Giraffe, and Denys and I later had to defend our^
selves against the charge of having killed this one, but we
could prove that it had been dead some time when we came
upon it, though it was never found by whom or why it
had been killed. Upon the huge carcass of the Giraffe, a
lioness had been feeding, and now raised her head and
shoulder above it to watch the passing car.

Denys stopped the car, and Kanuthia lifted the rifle, that
he carried, off his shoulder. Denys asked me in a low voice:
“Shall I shoot her?”— For he very courteously looked on
the Ngong Hill as my private hunting-ground.— We were
going across the land of the same Masai who had been to
my house to bewail the loss of their cattle; if this was the
animal which had killed one after the other of their cows
and calves, the time had come to put an end to her- 1
nodded.

He jumped from the car and slid back a few steps, at
the same moment the lioness dived down behind the body
of the Giraffe, he ran round the Giraffe to get within shot
of her, and fired. I did not see her fall; when I got out and
up to her she was lying dead in a big black pool.

There was no time to skin her, we must drive on if we
were to cut off the Safari at Narok. We gazed round and
took note of the place, the smell of the dead Giraffe was

229



OUT OF AFRICA


so strong that we could not very well pass it unknowingly.

But when we had driven a further two miles there was
no more road. The tools of the road-labourers lay here; on
the other side of them was the wide stony land, just grey
in the dawn, all unbroken by any touch of man. We looked
at the tools and at the country, we would have to leave
Denys’s friend to take his chance with the rifle. After-
wards, when he came back, he told us that he had never had
an opportunity to use it. So we turned back, and as we
turned we got our faces to the Eastern sky, reddening over
the plains and the hills. We drove towards it and talked all
the time of the lioness.

The Giraffe came within view, and by this time we
could see him clearly and distinguish,— where the light fell
on to his side,— the darker square spots on his skin. And as
we came near to him we saw that there was a lion standing
on him. In approaching we were a little lower than the
carcass; the lion stood straight up over it, dark, and behind
him the sky was now all aflame. Lion Passant Or. A bit of
his mane was lifted by the wind. I rose up in the car, so
strong was the impression that he made, and Denys at that
said: '‘You shoot this time.” I was never keen to shoot with
his rifle, which was too long and heavy for me, and gave
me a bad shock; still here the shot was a declaration of love,
should the rifle not then be of the biggest caliber? As I
shot it seemed to me that the lion jumped straight up in
the air, and came down with his legs gathered under him.
I stood, panting, in the grass, aglow with the plenipotence
that a shot gives you, because you take effect at a distance.
I walked round the carcass of the Giraffe. There it was,—
the fifth act of a classic tragedy. They were all dead now.
The Giraffe was looking terribly big, austere, with his four
stiff legs and long stiff neck, his belly tom open by the lions.
230



VISITORS TO THE FARM


The lioness, lying on her back, had a great haughty snarl
on her face, she was the fermne fatale of the tragedy. The
lion was lying not far from her, and how was it that he
had learned nothing by her fate? His head was laid on his
two front paws, his mighty mane covered him as a royal
mantle, he too was resting in a big pool, and by now the
morning air was so light that it showed scarlet.

Denys and Kanuthia pulled up their sleeves and while
the sun rose they skinned the lions. When they took a
rest we had a bottle of claret, and raisins and almonds, from
the car; I had brought them with us to eat on the road,
because it was New Year’s Day. We sat on the short grass
and ate and drank. The dead lions, close by, looked mag-
nificent in their nakedness, there was not a particle of
superfluous fat on them, each muscle was a bold controlled
curve, they needed no cloak, they were, all through, what
they ought to be.

As we sat there, a shadow hastened over the grass and
over my feet, and looking up I could distinguish, high in
the light-blue sky, the circling of the vultures. My heart
v-as as light as if I had been flying it, up there, on a string,
as you fly a kite. I made a poem:

The eagle’s shadow runs across the plain,

Towards the distant, nameless, air-blue mountains.
But the shadows of the round young Zebra
Sit close between their delicate hoofs all day,
where they stand immovable,

And wait for the evening, wait to stretch out, blue.
Upon a plain, painted brick-red by the sunset.

And to wander to the water-hole.

Denys and I had another dramatic adventure with lions.

2^1



OUT OF AFRICA

Ic happened, in reality, before the other, in the early days
of our friendship.

One morning, during the spring-rains, Mr. Nichols, a
South African, who was then my Manager, came to my
house all aflame, to tell me, that in the night two lions had
been to the farm and had killed two of our oxen. They
had broken tlirough the fence of the oxen’s fold, and they
had dragged the dead oxen into the coffee plantation; one
of them they had eaten up there, but the other was lying
amongst the coffee-trees. Would I now write him a letter
to go and get strychnine in Nairobi? He would have it laid
out in the carcass at once, for he thought that the lions
would be sure to come back in the night.

I thought it over; it went against me to lay out strychnine
for lions, and I told him that I could not see my way to
do it. At that his excitement changed over into exaspera-
tion. The lions, he said, if they were left in peace over this
crime, would come back another time. The bullocks they
had killed were our best working bullocks, and we could
not afford to lose any more. The stable of my ponies, he
reminded me, was not far from the oxen’s enclosure, had
I thought of that? I explained that I did not mean to keep
the lions on the farm, only I thought that they should be
shot and not poisoned.

“And who is going to shoot them?” asked Nichols, “I
am no coward, but I am a married man and I have no wish
to risk my life unnecessarily.” It was true that he was no
coward, he was a plucky little man. “There would be no
sense in it,” he said. No, I said, I did not mean to make him
shoot the Hons. But Mr. Finch-Hatton had arrived the night
before and was in the house, he and I would go. “Oh, that
is O.K.” said Nichols.

I then went in to find Denys. “Come now,” I said to him,
232



VISITORS TO THE FARM
“and let us go and risk our lives unnecessarily. For if thej
have got any value at all it is this that they have got none
Frei lebt wer sterben kannP

We went down and found the dead bullock in the coffee
plantation, as Nichols had told me; it had hardly been
touched by the lions. Their spoor was deep and clear in the
soft ground, two big lions had been here in the night. It
was easy to follow through the plantation and up to the
wood round Belknap’s house, but by the time that we came
there it had rained so heavily that it was difficult to see any-
thing, and in the grass and the bush at the edge of the wood
we lost the track.

“What do you think, Denys,” I asked him, “will they
come back to-night?”

Denys had great experience with lions. He said that they
would come back early in the night to finish the meat, and
that we ought to give them time to settle down on it, and
go down to the field ourselves at nine o’clock. We would
have to use an electric torch from his Safari outfit, to shoot
by, and he gave me the choice of the roles, but I would
rather let him shoot and myself hold the torch for him.

In order that we might find our way up to the dead ox
in the dark, we cut up strips of paper and fastened them on
the rows of coffee-trees between which we meant to walk,
marking our way in the manner of Hanzl and Gretl with
their little white stones. It would take us straight to the
kill, and at the end of it, twenty yards from the carcass,
we tied a larger piece of paper to the tree, for here we
would stop, sweep the light on and shoot. Late in the after-
noon, when we took out the torch to try it, we found that
the batteries of it had been running down and that the light
it gave was only faint. There was no time to go in to



OUT OF AFRICA

Nairobi with it now, so that we should have to make the
best of it as it was.

It was the day before Denys’s birthday, and while we
dined, he was in a melancholic mood, reflecting that he had
not had enough out of life till now. But something, I con-
soled him, might still happen to him before his birthday
morning. I told Juma to get out a bottle of wine to be
ready for us when we should come back. I kept on thinking
of the lions, where would they be now, at this moment.^
Were they crossing the river, slowly, silently, the one in
front of the other, the gentle cold flow of the river tur ning
round their chests and flanks.^

At nine o’clock we went out.

It rained a little, but there was a moon; from time to
time she put out her dim white face high up in the sky,
behind layers and layers of thin clouds, and was then dimly
mirrored in the white-flowering coffee-field. We passed the
school at a distance; it was all lighted up.

At this sight a great wave of triumph and of pride in my
people swept through me. I thought of King Solomon,
who says: “The slothful man saith. There is a lion in the
way; a lion is in the streets.” Here were two lions just out-
side ±eir door, but my school-children were not slothful
and had not let the lions keep them from school.

We found our marked two rows of coffee-trees, paused
a moment, and proceeded up between them, one in front
of the other. We had moccasins on, and walked silently. I
began to shake and tremble with excitement, I dared not
come too near to Denys for fear that he might feel it and
send me back, but I dared not keep too far away from him
either, for he might need my torchlight any moment.

The lions, we found afterwards, had been on the kill.
When they heard us, or smelt us, they had walked off it a
254 .

little way into the coffee-field to let us pass. Probably be-
cause they thought that we were passing too slowly, the
one of them gave a very low hoarse growl, in front and to
the right of us. It was so low that we were not even sure
that we had heard it, Denys stopped a second; without
turning he asked me: “Did you hear?’’ “Yes,” I said.

We walked a little again and the deep growling was re-
peated, this time straight to the right. “Put on the light,”
Denys said. It was not altogether an easy job, for he was
much taller than I, and I had to get the light over his
shoulder on to his rifle and further on. As I lighted the
torch the whole world changed into a brilliantly lighted
stage, the wet leaves of the coffee-trees shone, the clods of
the ground showed up quite clearly.

First the circle of light struck a little wide-eyed jackal,
like a small fox; I moved it on, and there was the lion. He
stood facing us straight, and he looked very light, with all
the black African night behind him. When the shot fell,
close to me, I was unprepared for it, even without com-
prehension of what it meant, as if it had been thunder, as
if I had been myself shifted into the place of the lion. He
went down like a stone. “Move on, move on,” Denys cried
to me. I turned the torch further on, but my hand shook
so badly that the circle of light, which held all the world,
and which I commanded, danced a dance. I heard Denys
laugh beside me in the dark.--“The torch-work on the
second lion,” he said to me later, “was a little shaky.”—But
in the centre of the dance was the second lion, going away
from us and half hidden by a coffee-tree. As the light
reached him he turned his head and Denys shot. He fell
out of the circle, but got up and into it again, he swung
round towards us, and just as the second shot fell, he gave
one long irascible groan.


235



OUT OF AFRICA

Africa, in a second, grew endlessly big, and Denys and
I, standing upon it, infinitely small. Outside our torchlight
there was nothing but darkness, in the darkness in two di-
rections there were lions, and from the sky rain. But when
the deep roar died out, there was no movement anywhere,
and the lion lay still, his head turned away on to his side, as
in a gesture of disgust. There were two big dead animals
in the coffee-field, and the silence of night all around.

We walked up to the lions and paced out the distance.
From where we had stood the first lion was thirty yards
away and the other twenty-five. They were both full-
grown, young, strong, fat lions. The two close friends, out
in the hills or on the plains, yesterday had taken the same
great adventure into their heads, and in it they had died
together.

By now all the school children were coming out of the
school, pouring down the road to stop in sight of us and
there to cry out in a low soft voice: “Msabu. Are you
there.^ Arc you there? Msabu, Msabu.”

I sat on a lion and cried back to them: “Yes I am.”

Then they went on, louder and more boldly: “Has Bedar
shot the lions? Both two?” When they found that it was
so, they were at once all over the place, like a swarm of
small spring-hares of the night, jumping up and down.
They, then and there, made a song upon the event; it ran
as follows: “Three shots. Two lions. Three shots. Two
lions.” They embroidered and embellished it as they sang it,
one clear voice falling in after the other: “Three good shots,
two big strong bad kali lions.” And then they all joined into
an intoxicated refrain: “A.B.C.D.”, -because they came
straight from the school, and had their heads filled with
wisdom.

In a short time a great number of people came to the
236



VISITORS TO THE FARM


spot, the labourers from the mill, the squatters of the neai
manyattas, and my houseboys, carrying hurricane-lamps.
They stood round the lions and talked about them, then
Kanuthia and the Sice, who had brought knives, set to skin
them. It was the skin of one of these lions that, later, I gave
to the Indian High Priest. Pooran Singh himself appeared
on the stage, in a negligee which made him look unbe-
lievably slight, his melliferous Indian smile shone in the
midst of his thick black beard, he stuttered with delight
when he spoke. He was anxious to procure for himself the
fat of the lions, that with his people is held in high esteem
as a medicine,— from the pantomime by which he expressed
himself to me, I believe against rheumatism and impotence.
With all this the coffee-field became very lively, the rain
stopped, the moon shone down on them all.

We went back to the house and Juma brought and
opened our bottle. We were too wet, and too dirty with mud
and blood to sit down to it, but stood up before a flaming
fire in the dining room and drank our live, singing wine up
quickly. We did not speak one word. In our hunt we had
been a unity and v^e had nothing to say to one another.

Our friends got a good deal of entertainment out of our
adventure. Old Mr. Bulpett when next we came in to a
dance at the Club would not speak to us the whole evening.

To Denys Finch-Hatton I owe what was, I think, the
greatest, the most transporting pleasure of my life on the
farm: I flew with him over Africa. There, where there are
few or no roads and where you can land on the plains,
flying becomes a thing of real and vital importance in your
life, it opens up a world. Denys had brought out his Moth
machine; it could land on my plain on the farm only a few
minutes from the house, and we were up nearly every day.

237



OUT OF AFRICA

You have tremendous views as you get up above the
African highlands, surprising combinations and changes of
light and colouring, the rainbow on the green sunlit land,
the gigantic upright clouds and big wild black storms, all
swing round you in a race and a dance. The lashing hard
showers of rain whiten the air askance. The language is
short of words for the experiences of flying, and will have
to invent new words with time. When you have flown over
the Rift Valley and the volcanoes of Suswa and Longonot,
you have travelled far and have been to the lands on the
other side of the moon. You may at other times fly low
enough to see the animals on the plains and to feel towards
them as God did when he had just created them, and be-
fore he commissioned Adam to give them names.

But it is not the visions but the activity which makes
you happy, and the joy and glory of the flyer is the flight
itself. It is a sad hardship and slavery to people who live in
towns, that in all their movements they know of one di-
mension only; they walk along the line as if they were led
on a string. The transition from the line to the plane into
the two dimensions, when you wander across a field or
through a wood, is a splendid liberation to the slaves, like
the French Revolution. But in the air you are taken into
the full freedom of the three dimensions; after long ages of
exile and dreams the homesick heart throws itself into the
arms of space. The laws of gravitation and time,

. in life’s green grove,

Sport like tame beasts, none knew how
gentle they could be!”

Every time that I have gone up in an aeroplane and look-
ing down have realised that I was free of the ground, I
2^8



VISITORS TO THE FARM


have had the consciousness of a great new discovery. “I
see;” I have thought, “This was the idea. And now I un-
derstand everything.”

One day Denys and I flew to Lake Natron, ninety miles
South-East of the farm, and more than four thousand feet
lower, two thousand feet above Sea level. Lake Natron is
the place from where they take soda. The bottom of the
lake and the shores are like some sort of whitish concrete,
with a strong, sour and salt smell.

The sky was blue, but as we flew from the plains in over
the stony and bare lower country, all colour seemed to be
scorched out of it. The whole landscape below us looked
like delicately marked tortoise-shell. Suddenly, in the midst
of it was the lake. The white bottom, shining through the
water, gives it, when seen from the air, a strildng, an un-
believable azure-colour, so clear that for a moment you
shut your eyes at it; the expanse of water lies in the bleak
tawny land like a big bright aquamarine. We had been
flying high, now we went down, and as we sank our own
shade, dark-blue, floated under us upon the light-blue lake.
Here live thousands of Flamingoes, although I do not know
how they exist in the brackish water,— surely there are no
fish here. At our approach they spread out in large circles
and fans, like the rays of a setting sun, like an artful Chinese
pattern on silk or porcelain, forming itself and changing,
as we looked at it.

We landed on the white shore, that was white-hot as an
oven, and lunched there, taking shelter against the sun under
the wing of the aeroplane. If you stretched out your hand
from the shade, the sun was so hot that it hurt you. Our
bottles of beer when they first arrived with us, straight out
of the ether, were pleasantly cold, but before we had fin-

239



OUT OF AFRICA

ished them, in a quarter of an hour, they became as hot as
a cup of tea.

While we were lunching, a party of Masai warriors ap^
peared on the horizon, and approached quickly. They must
have spied the aeroplane landing from a distance, and re-
solved to have a close look at it, and a walk of any length,
even in a country like this, means nothing to a Masai. They
came along, the one in front of the other, naked, tall and
narrow, their weapons glinting; dark like peat on the yellow
grey sand. At the feet of each of them lay and marched a
small pool of shadow, these were, besides our own, the
only shadows in the country as far as the eye reached.
When they came up to us they fell in line, there were five
of them. They stuck their heads together and began to talk
to one another about the aeroplane and us. A generation
ago they would have been fatal to us to meet. After a time
one of them advanced and spoke to us. As they could only
speak Masai and we understood but little of the language,
the conversation soon slackened, he stepped back to his
fellows and a few minutes later they all turned their back
upon us, and walked away, in single file, with the wide
white burning salt-plain before them.

“Would you care,’^ said Denys, “to fly to Naivasha? But
the country lying between is very rough, we could not
possibly land anywhere on the way. So we shall have to
go up high and keep up at twelve thousand feet.”

The flight from Lake Natron to Naivasha was Das ding
an sich. We took a bee-line, and kept at twelve thousand
feet all the way, which is so high that there is nothing to
look down for. At Lake Natron I had taken off my lamb-
skin-lined cap, now up here the air squeezed my forehead,
as cold as iced water; all my hair flew backwards as if my
head was being pulled off. This path, in fact, was the same
240



VISITORS TO THE FARM


as was, in the opposite direction, every evening taken by
the Roc, when, with an Elephant for her young in each
talon, she swished from Uganda home to Arabia. Where
you are sitting in front of your pilot, with nothing but
space before you, you feel that he is carrying you upon
the outstretched palms of his hands, as the Djinn carried
Prince All through the air, and that the wings that bear
you onw^ard are his. We landed at the farm of our friends
at Naivasha; the mad diminutive houses, and the very small
trees surrounding them, all threw themselves flat upon their
backs as they saw us descending.

When Denys and I had not time for long journeys we
went out for a short flight over the Ngong Hills, generally
about sunset. These hills, which are amongst the most beau-
tiful in the world, are perhaps at their loveliest seen from
the air, when the ridges, bare towards the four peaks,
mount, and run side by side with the aeroplane, or suddenl)/
sink down and flatten out into a small lawn.

Here in the hills there were Buffaloes. I had even, in my
very young days,— when I could not live till I had killed
a specimen of each kind of African game,— shot a bull out
here. Later on, when I was not so keen to shoot as to watch
the wild animals, I had been out to see them again. I had
camped in the hills by a spring half way to the top, bring-
ing my servants, tents, and provisions with me, and Farah
and I had been up in the dark, ice cold mornings to creep
and crawl through bush and long grass, in the hope of
catching a glimpse of the herd; but twice I had had to go
back without success. That the herd lived there, neighbours
of mine to the West, was still a value in the life on the
farm, but they were serious-minded, self-sufScient neigh-
bours, the old nobility of the hills, now somehow reduced;
they did not receive much.


241



OUT OF AFRICA

But one afternoon as I was having tea with some friends
of mine from up-country, outside the house, Denys came
flying from Nairobi and went over our heads out West-
wards; a little while after he turned and came back and
landed on the farm. Lady Delamere and I drove down
to the plain to fetch him up, but he would not get out of
his aeroplane.

“The Buffalo are out feeding in the hills,” he said, “come
out and have a look at them.”

“I cannot come,” I said, “I have got a tea-party up at
the house.”

“But we will go and see them and be back in a quarter
of an hour,” said he.

This sounded to me like the propositions which people
make to you in a dream. Lady Delamere would not fly, so
I went up with him. We flew in the sun, but the hillside lay
in a transparent brown shade, which soon we got into. It
did not take us long to spy the Buffalo from the air. Upon
one of the long rounded green ridges which run, like folds
of a cloth gathered together at each peak, down the side of
the Ngong mountain, a herd of twenty-seven Buffalo were
grazing. First we saw them a long way below us, like mice
moving gently on a floor, but we dived down, circling over
and along their ridge, a hundred and fifty feet above them
and well within shooting distance; we counted them as they
peacefully blended and separated. There was one very old
big black bull in the herd, one or two younger bulls, and
a number of calves. The open stretch of sward upon which
they walked was closed in by bush; had a stranger ap-
proached on the ground they would have heard or scented
him at once, but they were not prepared for advance from
the air. We had to keep moving above them all the time.
They heard the noise of our machine and stopped grazing,
242



VISITORS TO THE FARM


but they did not seem to have it in them to look up. In the
end they realized that something very strange was about;
the old bull first walked out in front of the herd, raising
his hundredweight horns, braving the unseen enemy, his
four feet planted on the ground,— suddenly he began to
trot down the ridge and after a moment he broke into a
canter. The whole clan now followed him, stampeding
headlong down, and as they switched and plunged into the
bush, dust and loose stones rose in their wake. In the thicket
they stopped and kept close together, it looked as if a small
glade in the hill had been paved with dark grey stones.
Here they believed themselves to be covered to the view,
and so they were to anything moving along the ground,
but they could not hide themselves from the eyes of the
bird of the air. We flew up and away. It was like having
been taken into the heart of the Ngong Hills by a secret
unknown road.

When I came back to my tea-party, the teapot on the
stone table was still so hot that I burned my fingers on it.
The Prophet had the same experience when he upset a jug
of water, and the Archangel Gabriel took him, and flew
with him through the seven heavens, and when he returned,
the water had not yet run out of the jug.

In the Ngong Hills there also lived a pair of eagles.
Denys in the afternoons used to say: “Let us go and visit
the eagles.” I have once seen one of them sitting on a
stone near the top of the mountain, and getting up from it,
but otherwise they spent their life up in the air. Many
times we have chased one of these eagles, careening and
throwing ourselves on to one wing and then to the other,
and I believe that the sharp-sighted bird played with us.
Once, when we were running side by side, Denys stopped

24 ^



OUT OF AFRICA

his engine in mid air, and as he did so I heard the eagle
screech.

The Natives liked the aeroplane, and for a time it was
the fashion on the farm to portray her, so that I would find
sheets of paper in the kitchen, or the kitchen wall itself,
covered with drawings of her, with the letters ABAK
carefully copied out. But they did not really take any in-
terest in her or in our flying.

Natives dislike speed, as we dislike noise, it is to them,
at the best, hard to bear. They are also on friendly terms
with time, and the plan of beguiling or killing it does not
come into their heads. In fact the more time you can give
them, the happier they are, and if you commission a Kikuyu
to hold your horse while you make a visit, you can see by
his face that he hopes you will be a long, long time about
it. He does not try to pass the time then, but sits down and
lives.

Neither do the Natives have much sympathy with any
kind of machinery or mechanics. A group of the young
generation have been carried away by the enthusiasm of
the European for the motor-car, but an old Kikuyu said to
me of them that they would die young, and it is likely that
he was right, for renegades come of a weak line of the na-
tion. Amongst the inventions of civilization which the
Natives admire and appreciate are matches, a bicycle and
a rifle, still they will drop these the moment there is any
talk of a cow.

Frank Greswolde-Williams, of the Kedong Valley, took
a Masai with him to England as a Sice, and told me that a
week after his arrival he rode his horses in Hyde Park as iJ
he had been born in London. I asked this man when h<
came back to Africa what he found very good in England
He thought my question over with a grave face and afte

a long time courteously said that the white men had got
very fine bridges.

I have never seen an old Native who, for things which
moved by themselves without apparent interference by
man or by the forces of Nature, expressed anything but
distrust and a certain feeling of shame. The human mind
turns away its eye from witchcraft as from something un-
seemly. It may be forced to take an interest in the effects
of it, but it will have nothing to do with the inside working,
and no one has ever tried to squeeze out of a witch the
exact recipe for her brew.

Once, when Denys and I had been up, and were landing
on the plain of the farm, a very old Kikuyu came up and
talked to us:

“You were up very high to-day,” he said, “we could not
see you, only hear the aeroplane sing like a bee.”

I agreed that we had been up high.

“Did you see God?” he asked.

“No, Ndwetti,” I said, “we did not see God.”

“Aha, then you were not up high enough,” he said, “but
now tell me: do you think that you will be able to get up
high enough to see him?”

“I do not know, Ndwetti,” I said.

“And you, Bedar,” he said, turning to Denys, “what do
you think? Will you get up high enough in your aeroplane
to see God?”

“Really I do not know,” said Denys.

“Then,” said Ndwetti, “I do not know at all why you
two go on flying.”

/4 A y manager during the war had been buying up
V I oxen for the army. He told me that he had then,
down in the Masai Reserve, bought from the Masai a num-
ber of young oxen, which were offspring of Masai cattle
and Buffalo. It is a much debated question whether it is
possible to cross domestic animals with the game; many
people have tried to create a type of small horse fitted to
the country, by breeding from Zebra and horses, though
I myself have never seen such cross-breeds. But my Mana^
ger assured me that these oxen were really half-Buffalo.
They had been, the Masai told him, a much longer time
growing up than the ordinary cattle, and the Masai, who
were proud of them, were by this time pleased to get rid
of them, as they were very wild.

It was found to be hard work to train these oxen for the


waggon or plough. One strong young animal amongst them
gave my Manager and his Native ox-drivers endless trouble.
He stormed against the men, he broke their yokes, he
foamed and bellowed; when tied up he shovelled up earth
in thick black clouds, he turned up the bloodshot white of
his eyes, and blood, the men said, was running from his
nose. The man, like the beast, towards the end of their


249



OUT OF AFRICA


Struggle, was dead beat, the sweat streaming down his ach-
ing body.

‘‘To break the heart of this ox,” my Manager narrated,
“I had him thrown in the bullocks’ paddock, with his four
legs tied hard together, and a rein round his muzzle, and
even then, as he was lying dumb on the ground, long
scalding jets of steam stood out from his nose and terrible
snorts and sighs came from his throat. I was looking for-
ward to seeing him under the yoke for many years to come.
I went to bed in my tent and I kept on dreaming of this
black ox. I was woken up by a big row, the dogs barking
and the Natives shouting and yelling down by the paddock.
Two herdboys came into my tent all trembling and told me
that they believed a lion had got in amongst the oxen. We
ran down to the place and took lamps with us, and I my-
self brought my rifle. As we came near to the paddock the
noise died down a little. In the light of the lamps I saw a
speckled thing making off. A leopard had been at the
tied-up ox, and had eaten the right hind-leg off him. We
would never come to see him in the yoke now.

“Then,” said my Manager, “I took my rifle and shot the


THE FIREFLIES

Here in the highlands, when the long rains are over, and
in the first week of June nights begin to be cold, we get
the fireflies in the woods.

On an evening you will see two or three of them, ad-
venturous lonely stars floating in the clear air, rising and
lowering, as if upon waves, or as if curtseying. To that
rhythm of their flight they lighten and put out their diminu-
tive lamps. You may catch the insect and make it shine
250



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

upon the palm of your hand, giving out a strange light, a
mysterious message, it turns the flesh pale green in a small
circle round it. The next night there are hundreds and
hundreds in the woods.

For some reason they keep within a certain height, four
or five feet, above the ground. It is impossible then not to
imagine that a whole crowd of children of six or seven
years, are running through the dark forest carrying candles,
little sticks dipped in a magic fire, joyously jumping up
and down, and gambolling as they run, and swinging their
small pale torches merrily. The woods are filled with a wild
frolicsome life, and it is all perfectly silent.

THE ROADS OF LIFE

When I was a child I was shown a picture,— a kind of
moving picture inasmuch as it was created before your
eyes and while the artist was telling the story of it. This

In a little round house with a round window and a little
triangular garden in front there lived a man.

Not far from the house there was a

One night the man was woken up by a ter-

cause of it. He took the road to the pond.

map of the movements of an army, a plan of the roads

that it was a stork. But through them all he kept his purpose

esa’s story

At the time of the war I had a Cook named Esa, an old
man of much sense and a gentle disposition. One day when
I was in Mackinnon’s grocery shop in Nairobi, buying tea
and spices, a small lady with a sharp face came up to me
and remarked that she knew Esa was in my service; I said
that it was so. “But he has been with me before,” said the
lady, “and I want him back.” I said that I was sorry about
that, as she would not get him. “Oh, I do not know about
that,” she said. “My husband is a Government OfEcial. Will
you please tell Esa when you go home, that I want him
back, and that if he does not come he will be taken for the
Carrier Corps? I understand,” she added, “that you have got
enough servants without Esa.”

I did not tell Esa of these happenings straight away, only
the next evening did I remember about them, and told
him that I had met his old mistress, and of what she had said

^53



OUT OF AFRICA

to me. To my surprise Esa was immediately beside himself
with fear and despair. “Oh, why did you not tell me at
once, Memsahib!’’ said he, “the lady will do what she has
told you, and I must leave you to-night.’’ “That is all non-
sense,” I said. “I do not think that they can take you like
that.” “God help me,” said Esa, “I am afraid it may be too
late already.” “But what am I to do for a Cook, Esa?” I
asked him. “Well,” said Esa, “you will not have me for a
Cook either when I am with the Carrier Corps, nor when I
am lying dead, as I shall surely then be very soon,”

So deep was the fear of the Carrier Corps in the people
in those days that Esa would not listen to anything I had
to say. He asked me for the loan of a hurricane-lamp, and
set off in the night to Nairobi, with what belongings he had
in the world tied up in a cloth.

Esa was away from the farm for nearly a year. During
that time I saw him a couple of times in Nairobi and once I
passed him on the Nairobi road. He was growing old and
thin, and drawn in the face, in the course of this year, his
dark round head was going grey on the top. In the town
he would not stop to speak to me, but when we met on the
flat road and I pulled up my car, he put down the chicken-
coop which he was carrying on his head, and settled down
to a talk.

He had, as before, a gentle manner, but all the same he
was changed, and it was now difficult to get into contact
with him; he remained, all through our conversation, absent-
minded, as if at a distance. He had been ill-used by fate, and
deadly frightened, and had had to draw upon resources un-
known to me, and through these experiences he had become
chastened or clarified. It was like talking with an old ac-
quaintance who has entered upon his novitiate in a monas-
tery.

254



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

He asked me about things on the farm, taking it, as Na-
tive servants usually do, that his fellow-servants in his absence
were behaving as badly as possible to the white master.
“When will the war be over?” he asked me. I said that I
had been told that now it would not last much longer. “If
it lasts ten years longer,” he said, “you must know that I
shall have forgotten to make the dishes you have taught
me.

The mind of the little old Kikuyu, upon the road across
the plains, was running upon the same line as that of Brillat
Savarin, who said that if the Revolution had lasted five
years longer, the art of making a chicken-ragout would
have been lost.

It was obvious that Esa’s regrets were mainly on my be-
half, and to put an end to his commiserations I asked him
how he was himself. He thought my question over for a
minute, there were thoughts which had to be collected
from far away before he could answer. “Do you remem-
ber, Memsahib?” he said in the end, “that you said it was
hard on the oxen of the Indian firewood-contractors to be
inspanned every day, and never to have a whole day’s rest,
as the farm oxen have got? Now, with the lady, I am like
an Indian firewood-contractor’s ox.” Esa looked away when
he had spoken, apologetically,— Natives have in themselves
very little feeling for animals; my saying about the Indian’s
oxen probably had struck him as very far-fetched. That
now he should, on his own, come back to it for himself,
was to him an unaccountable thing.

During the war it was to me a cause of much annoyance
that all letters, which I wrote or received, were opened by
a little sleepy Swedish Censor in Nairobi. He can never
have found anything the least suspicious in them, but he
came, I believe, within a monotonous life, to take an inter-



OUT OF AFRICA

est in the people on whom they turned, and to read my let-
ters as you read a serial in a magazine. I used to add in my
own letters a few threats against our Censor, to be carried
out after the end of the war, for him to read. When the end
of the war came he may have remembered these threats, or
he may on his own have woken up and repented; in any
case he sent a runner to the farm with news of the Armi-
stice. I was alone in the house when the runner arrived; I
walked out in the woods. It was very silent there, and it
was strange to think that it was silent on the fronts of
France and Flanders as well, —all the guns had been stilled.
In this stillness Europe and Africa seemed near to one an-
other, as if you could have walked by the forest-path on to
Vimy Ridge. When I came back to the house I saw a figure
standing outside. It was Esa with his bundle. He at once
told me that he had come back and that he had brought
me a present.

Esa’s present was a picture, framed and under glass, of a
tree, very carefully penned down in ink, every one of its
hundred leaves painted a clear green. Upon each leaf, in
diminutive Arabic letters, a word was written in red ink. I
take it that the writings came out of the Koran, but Esa
was incapable of explaining what they meant, he kept on
wiping off the glass with his sleeve and assuring me that it
was a very good present. He told me that he had had the
picture made, during his year of trial, by the old Moham-
medan priest of Nairobi, it must have taken the old man
hours and hours to print it down.

Esa now stayed with me till he died.

THE IGUANA

In the Reserve I have sometimes come upon the Iguana,
the big lizards, as they were sunning themselves upon a flat



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

stone in a river-bed. They are not pretty in shape, but noth?-
ing can be imagined more beautiful than their colouring.
They shine like a heap of precious stones or like a pane cut
out of an old church window. When, as you approach,
they swish away, there is a flash of azure, green and purple
over the stones, the colour seems to be standing behind
them in the air, like a comet’s luminous tail.

Once I shot an Iguana. I thought that I should be able to
make some pretty things from his skin. A strange thing
happened then, that I have never afterwards forgotten. As
I went up to him, where he was lying dead upon his stone,
and actually while I was walking the few steps, he faded
and grew pale, all colour died out of him as in one long
sigh, and by the time that I touched him he was grey and
dull like a lump of concrete. It was the live impetuous blood
pulsating within the animal, which had radiated out all that
glow and splendour. Now that the flame was put out, and
the soul had flown, the Iguana was as dead as a sandbag.

Often since I have, in some sort, shot an Iguana, and I
have remembered the one of the Reserve. Up at Meru I saw
a young Native girl with a bracelet on, a leather strap two
inches wide, and embroidered all over with very small tur-^
quoise-coloured beads which varied a little in colour and
played in green, light blue and ultramarine. It was an ex-
traordinarily live thing; it seemed to draw breath on her
arm, so that I wanted it for myself, and made Farah buy it
from her. No sooner had it come upon my own arm than it
gave up the ghost. It was nothing now, a small, cheap, pur-
chased article of finery. It had been the play of colours, the
duet between the turquoise and the “negre”,— that quick,
sweet, brownish black, like peat and black pottery, of the
Native’s skin,— that had created the life of the bracelet.

In the Zoological Museum of Pietermaritzburg, I have

257



OUT OF AFRICA

seen, in a stuffed deep-water fish in a showcase, the same
combination of colouring, which there had survived death;
it made me wonder what life can well be like, on the bot-
tom of the sea, to send up something so live and airy. I
stood in Mem and looked at my pale hand and at the dead
bracelet, it was as if an injustice had been done to a noble
thing, as if truth had been suppressed. So sad did it seem
that I remembered the saying of the hero in a book that I
had read as a child: ‘‘I have conquered them all, but I am
standing amongst graves.”

In a foreign country and with foreign species of life one
should take measures to find out whether things will be
keeping their value when dead. To the settlers of East Af-'
rica I give the advice: 'Tor the sake of your own eyes and
heart, shoot not the Iguana.”

FARAH AND THE MERCHANT OF VENICE

Once a friend at home wrote out to me and described a
new staging of "The Merchant of Venice.” In the evening
as I was reading the letter over again, the play became vivid
to me, and seemed to fill the house, so much, that I called in
Far ah to talk with him about it, and explained the plot of
the comedy to him.

Farah, like all people of African blood, Kked to hear a
story told, but only when he was sure that he and I were
alone in the house, did he consent to listen to one. It was
therefore when the houseboys were back in their own huts,
and any passer-by from the farm, looking in through the
windows, would have believed him and me to be discussing
household matters, that I narrated, and he listened, standing
up immovable at the end of the table, his serious eyes on my
face.



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

Farah gave his full attention to the affairs of Antonio,
Bassanio and Shylock. Here was a big, complicated busi-
ness deal, somewhat on the verge of the law, the real thing
to the heart of a Somali. He asked me a question or two as
to the clause of the pound of flesh: it obviously seemed to
him an eccentric, but not impossible agreement; men might
go in for that sort of thing. And here the story began to
smell of blood,—his interest in it rose. When Portia came
upon the stage, he pricked his ears; I imagined that he
saw her as a woman of his own tribe, Fathima with all saili
set, crafty and insinuating, out to outman man. Coloured
people do not take sides in a tale, the interest to them lies in
the ingeniousness of the plot itself; and the Somali, who in
real life have a strong sense of values, and a gift for moral
indignation, give these a rest in their fiction. Still, here
Farah’s sympathy was with Shylock, who had come down
with the cash; he repugned his defeat.

“What?” said he. “Did the Jew give up his claim? He
should not have done that. The flesh was due to him, it was
little enough for him to get for all that money.”

“But what else could he do,” I asked, “when he must not
take one drop of blood?”

“Memsahib,” said Farah, “he could have used a red-hot
knife. That brings out no blood.”

“But,” I said, “he was not allowed to take either more
or less than one pound of flesh.”

“And who,” said Farah, “would have been frightened by
that, exactly a Jew? He might have taken little bits at a
time, with a small scale at hand to weight it on, till he had
got just one pound. Had the Jew no friends to give him
advice?”

All Somalis have in their countenance something exceed-
ingly dramatic. Farah, with the slightest change of mien and

2^0



OUT OF AFRICA

carriage, now took on a dangerous aspect, as if he were
really in the Court of Venice, putting heart into his friend
or partner Shylock, in the face of the crowd of Antonio’s
friends, and of the Doge of Venice himself. His eyes flick-
ered up and down the figure of the Merchant before him,
with the breast bared to the knife.

“Look, Memsahib,” he said, “he could have taken small
bits, very small. He could have done that man a lot of harm,
even a long time before he had got that one pound of his
flesh.”

I sdd: “But in the story the Jew gave it up.”

“Yes, that was a great pity, Memsahib,” said Farah.

THE ELITE OF BOURNEMOUTH

I had as neighbour a settler who had been a doctor at
home. Once, when the wife of one of my houseboys was
about to die in childbirth, and I could not get into Nairobi,
because the long rains had ruined the roads, I wrote to my
neighbour and asked him to do me the great service to come
over and help her. He very kindly came, in the midst of a
terrible thunderstorm and torrents of tropical rain, and, at
the last moment, by his skill, Ke saved the life of the woman
and the child.

Afterwards he wrote me a letter to say, that although he
had for once, on my appeal, treated a Native, I must under-
stand that he could not let that sort of thing occur again.
I myself would fully realize the fact, he felt convinced,
when he informed me that he had before now practised to
the Elite of Bournemouth.

OF PRIDE

The neighbourhood of the Game Reserve and the pres-
ence, outside our boundary, of the big game, gave a par-
260



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK
ficular character to the farm, as if we had been the neigh-
bours of a great king. Very proud things were about, and
made their nearness felt.

The barbarian loves his own pride, and hates, or dis-
believes in, the pride of others. I will be a civilized being,
I will love the pride of my adversaries, of my servants, and
tny lover; and my house shall be, in all humility, in the
wilderness a civilized place.

Pride is faith in the idea that God had, when he made us.
A proud man is conscious of the idea, and aspires to realize
it. He does not strive towards a happiness, or comfort,
which may be irrelevant to God’s idea of him. His success,
is the idea of God, successfully carried through, and he is
in love with his destiny. As the good citizen finds his happi-
ness in the fulfilment of his duty to the community, so does
the proud man find his happiness in the fulfilment of his
fate.

People who have no pride are not aware of any idea of
God in the making of them, and sometimes they make you
doubt that there has ever been much of an idea, or else it
has been lost, and who shall find it again? They have got to
accept as success what others warrant to be so, and to take
their happiness, and even their own selves, at the quota-
tion of the day. They tremble, with reason, before their
fate.

Love the pride of God beyond all things, and the pride
of your neighbour as your own. The pride of lions: do not
shut them up in Zoos. The pride of your dogs: let them not
grow fat. Love the pride of your fellow-partisans, and al-
low them no self-pity.

Love the pride of the conquered nations, and leave them
to honour their father and their mother.

THE OXEN

Saturday afternoon was a blessed time on the farm. First
of all, there would now be no mail in till Monday afternoon,
so that no distressing business letters could reach us till
then, and this fact in itself seemed to close the whole place
in, as within an enceinte. Secondly, everybody was looking
forw^ard to the day of Sunday, w^hen they would rest or
play all the day, and the Squatters could w’ork on their own
land. The thought of the oxen on Saturday pleased me
more than all other things. I used to walk down to their
paddock at six o’clock, when they were coming in after the
day’s work and a few hours’ grazing. To-morrow, I thought,
they would do nothing but graze all day.

We had one hundred and thirty-two oxen on the farm,
which meant eight w^orking teams and a few spare oxen.
Now in the golden dust of the sunset they came wandering
home across the plain in a long row, walking sedately, as
they did all things; while I sat sedately on the fence of the
paddock, smoking a cigarette of peace, and watching them.
Here came Nyose, Ngufu and Faru, with Msungu,— which
means a white man. The drivers also often give to their
teams the proper names of white men, and Delamere is a
common name in an ox. Here came old Malinda, the big
yellow ox that I liked best of the lot; his skin w^as strangely
marked with shadowy figures, like starfishes, from which
pattern perhaps he had his name, for Malinda means a skirt.

As in civilized countries all people have a chronic bad
conscience towards the slums, and feel uncomfortable when
they think of them, so in Africa you have got a bad con-
science, and feel a pang, when you think of the oxen. But to-
wards the oxen on the farm, I felt as, I suppose, a king will
be feeling towards his slums: “You are I, and I am you.”

262



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

The oxen in Africa have carried the heavy load of the
advance of European civilization. Wherever new land has
been broken they have broken it, panting and pulling knee-
deep in the soil before the ploughs, the long whips in the
air over them. Where a road has been made they have made
it; and they have trudged the iron and tools through the
land, to the yelling and shouting of the drivers, by tracks in
the dust and the long grass of the plains, before there ever
were any roads. They have been inspanned before daybreak,
and have sweated up and down the long hills, and across
dungas and river-beds, through the burning hours of the
day. The whips have marked their sides, and you will often
see oxen that have had an eye, or both of them, taken away
by the long cutting whip-lashes. The waggon-oxen of many
Indian and white contractors worked every day, all their
lives through, and did not know of the Sabbath.

It is a strange thing that we have done to the oxen. The
bull is in a constant stage of fury, rolling his eyes, shovel-
ling up the earth, upset by everything that gets within his
range of vision,— still he has got a life of his own, fire comes
from his nostrils, and new life from his loins; his days are
filled with his vital cravings and satisfactions. AU of that we
have taken away from the oxen, and in reward we have
claimed their existence for ourselves. The oxen walk along
within our own daily life, pulling hard all the time, crea-
tures without a life, things made for our use. They have
moist, limpid, violet eyes, soft muzzles, silky ears, they are
patient and dull in all their ways; sometimes they look as if
they were thinking about things.

There was in my time a law against bringing a waggon
or cart on the roads without a brake, and the waggon-
drivers were supposed to put on the brakes down all the
long hills of the country. But the law was not kept; half



OUT OF AFRICA


the waggons and carts on the roads had no brakes to them;
and on the others the brakes were but rarely put on. This
made downhill work terribly hard on the oxen. They had
to hold the loaded waggons up with their bodies, they laid
their heads back under the laboxir until their horns touched
the hump on their backs; their sides went like a pair of bel-
lows. I have many times seen the carts of the firewood mer-
chants which came along the Ngong Road, going into Nai-
robi the one after the other, like a long caterpillar, gain
speed down the hill in the Forest Reserve, the oxen vio-
lently zig-zagging down in front of them. I have also seen
the oxen stumble and fall under the weight of the cart, at
the bottom of the hill.

The oxen thought: “Such is life, and the conditions of the
world. They are hard, hard. It has all to be borne,— there is
nothing for it. It is a terribly difiicult thing to get the carts
down the hill, it is a matter of life and death. It cannot be
helped.”

If the fat Indians of Nairobi, who owned the carts, could
have brought themselves to pay two Rupees and have the
brakes put in order, or if the slow young Native driver on
the top of the loaded cart, had had it in him to get off and
put on the brake, if it was there, then it could have been
helped, and the oxen could have walked quietly down the
hill. But the oxen did not know, and went on, day after day,
in their heroic and desperate struggle, with the conditions
of life.


OF THE TWO RACES

The relation beuveen the white and the black race in
Africa in many ways resembles the relation between the
0 sexes.

If the one of the two sexes were told that they did not

/I A



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

play any greater part in the life of the other sex, than thhf
other sex plays within their own existence, they would be
shocked and hurt. If the lover or the husband were told
that he did not play any greater part in the life of his wife
or his mistress, than she played in his own existence, he
would be puzzled and indignant. If a wife or a mistress
were told that she did not play any greater part in the life
of her husband or her lover, than he played in her life, she
would be exasperated.

The real old-time men’s story that was never meant to
get to the ears of women, goes to prove this theory; and the
talk of the women, when they sit amongst themselves and
know that no man can hear them, goes to prove it.

The tales that white people tell you of their Native serv-
ants are conceived in the same spirit. If they had been told
that they played no more important part in the lives of the
Natives than the Natives played in their own lives, they
would have been highly indignant and ill at ease.

If you had told the Natives that they played no greater
part in the life of the white people than the white people
played in their lives, they would never have believed you,
but would have laughed at you. Probably in Native circles,
stories are passing about, and being repeated, which prove
the all-absorbing interest of the white people in the Kikuyu
or Kavirondo, and their complete dependence upon them.

A WAR-TIME SAFARI

When the war broke out, my husband and the two Swed-
ish assistants on the farm volunteered and went down to the
German border, where a provisional Intelligence Service
was being organized by Lord Delamere. I was then alone
on the farm. But shortly afterwards there began to be talk

265



OUT OF AFRICA

of a Concentration Camp for the white women of the coun-
try; they were believed to be exposed to danger from the
Natives. I was thoroughly frightened then, and thought: If
I am to go into a ladies’ Concentration Camp in this coun-
try for months,— and who knows how long the war is going
to last?— I shall die. A few days later I got the chance to go,
with a young Swedish farmer, a neighbour of ours, to Kj-
jabe, a station higher up the railway line, and there to be
in charge of a camp to which the runners from the border
brought in their news, which had then to be telegraphed on
to Headquarters in Nairobi.

At Kijabe I had my tent near the station, amongst stacks
of firewood for the railway engines. As the runners came in
at ail hours of the day or night, I came to work much to-
gether with the Goan Stationmaster. He was a small, mild
man, with a burning thirst for knowledge, unaffected by
the war around him. He asked me many questions of my
country, and made me teach him a little Danish, which he
thought would at some time come in highly useful to him.
He had a small boy of ten, named Victor; one day as I
walked up to the station, through the trellis-work of the
Verandah, I heard him going on teaching Victor his gram-
mar; “Victor, what is a pronoun?— what is a pronoun, Vic- *
tor?— You do not know?— Five hundred times have I told
you!”

The people down by the border kept on demanding pro-
visions and ammunition to be sent to them; my husband
wrote and instructed me to load up four ox-waggons and
to send them down as soon as possible. But I must not, he
wrote, let them go without a white man in charge of them,
for nobody knew where the Germans were, and the Masai
were in a state of high excitement at the idea of war, and -
on the move all over the Reserve. In those days the Ger-
266



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

mans were supposed to be ever5rw’here, and we kept senti-
nels by the great railway bridge of Kijabe to prevent them
blowing it up.

I engaged a young South African by the name of Klap-
prott, to go with the waggons, but when they were aU
loaded up, on the evening before the expedition was to start
off, he was arrested as a German. He was not a German,
and could prove it, so that only a short time afterwards he
got out of the arrest and changed his name. But at that hour
I saw in his arrestation, the finger of God, for now there
was nobody but me to take the waggons through the coun-
try. And in the early morning, while the old constellations
of the stars were still out, we set off down the long endless
Kijabe Hill, with the great plains of the Masai Reserve,—
iron-grey in the faint light of the dawn,— spread at our feet,
with lamps tied under the waggons, swinging, and with
much shouting and cracking of whips. I had four waggons,
with a full team of sixteen oxen to each, and five spare oxen,
and with me twenty-one young Kikuyus and three Somalis:
Farah, Ismail, the gun-bearer, and an old cook also named
Ismail, a very noble old man. My dog Dusk walked by my
side.

It was a pity that the Police when arresting Klapprott,
had at the same time arrested his mule. I had not been able
to recover it in all Kijabe, so that for the first few days I
had to walk in the dust beside the waggons. But later I
bought a mule and saddle from a man whom I met in the
Reserve, and again some time after a mule for Farah.

I was out then for three months. When we came down
to our place of destination, we were sent off again to collect
the stores of a big American shooting Safari that had been
camping near the border, and had left in a hurry at the
news of the war. From there the waggons had to go to new

267



OUT OF AFRICA

places. I learned to know the fords and water-holes of the
Masai Reserve, and to speak a little Masai. The roads every-
where were unbelievably bad, deep with dust, and barred
with blocks of stone taller than the waggons; later we trav-
elled mostly across the plains. The air of the African high-
lands went to my head like wine, I was all the time slightly
drunk with it, and the joy of these months was indescrib-
able. I had been out on a shooting Safari before, but I had
not till now been out alone with Africans.

The Somali and I, who felt responsible for the Govern-
ment’s property, lived in constant fear of losing the oxen
from lions. The lions were on the road, following after the
big transports of supplies of sheep and provisions, which
now continually were travelling along it to the border. In
the early mornings, as we drove on, we could see, for a
long way, the fresh spoor of the lions in the dust, upon the
waggon-tracks of the road. At night, when the oxen were
outspanned, there was always a risk of lions round the camp
frightening them, and making them stampede and spread
all over the country, where we would never find them
again. So we built tall circular fences of thorn-trees round
our outspanning and camping places, and sat up with rifles
by the camp-fires.

Here both Farah and Ismail, and old Ismail himself, felt
at such a safe distance from civilization that their tongues
were loosened, and they would narrate strange happenings
of Somaliland, or tales out of the Koran, and the Arabian
Nights. Both Farah and Ismail had been to sea, for the
Somali are a seafaring nation, and were, I believe, in old
days, great pirates of the Red Sea. They explained to me
how every live creature on the earth has got its replica at
the bottom of the sea: horses, lions, women and Giraffe all
live down there, and from time to time have been observed
268



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

by sailors. They also recounted tales of horses which live
at the bottom of the rivers of Somaliland, and at full-moon
nights come up to the grass-land to copulate with the Somali
mares grazing there, and breed foals of wonderful beauty
and swiftness. The vault of the nocturnal sky swung back
over our heads as we sat on, new constellations of stars came
up from the East. The smoke from the fire in the cold air
carried long sparks with it, the fresh firewood smelt sour.
From time to time the oxen suddenly all at once stirred,
stamped and squeezed together, sniffing up in the air, so
that old Ismail would climb on to the top of the loaded
waggon, and there swing his lamp, to observe and to frighten
off anything that might be about outside the fence.

We had many great adventures with lions: “Beware of
Siawa,” said the Native leader of a transport going North,
whom we met on the road. “Do not camp here. There are
two hundred lions at Siawa.” So we tried to get past Siawa
before nightfall, and hurried on, and as haste makes waste
on a Safari more than anywhere else, about sunset a wheel
of the last waggon stuck on a big stone, and it could go no
farther. While I was now holding the lamp to the people
working to lift it off, a lion took one of our spare oxen not
three yards from me. By shouting and cracking the whips,
for my rifles were with the Safari, we managed to frighten
off the lion, and the ox, that had run away with the lion
on his back, came back to us, but it had been badly mauled,
and died a couple of days later.

Many other strange tilings happened to us. At one time
an ox drank up all our supply of paraffin, died on us, and
left us without light of any kind until we got to an Indian
dhuka in the Reserve, deserted by the owner, where strangely
some of the goods were still untouched.

We were for a week camped close to a big camp of the

269



OUT OF AFRICA

Masai Morani, and the young warriors, in war-paint, with
spears and long shields, and head-dresses of lion-skin, were
round my tent day and night, to get news of the war and
of the Germans. My own people of the Safari liked this
camp, because here they bought milk from the Morani’s
herd of cattle that trekked about with them and was herded
by the young Masai boys, the Laioni, who as yet are too
young to become warriors. The juvenile Masai soldier-girls,
very lively and pretty, came into my tent to call on me.
They would always ask for the loan of my hand-mirror,
and, when they held it up to one another, they bared their
two rows of shining teeth to the mirror, like angry young
carnivora.

All news of the movements of the enemy had to pass
through Lord Delamere’s camp. But Lord Delamere was
moving all ovei the Reserve in such incredibly swift marches,
that nobody ever knew where his camp was to be found.
I had nothing to do with Intelligence Work, but I won-
dered how the system worked for the people employed in
it. Once my way took me within a couple of miles of Lord
Delamere’s camp, and I rode over with Farah and had tea
with him. The place, although he was to break camp next
day, was like a city, swarming with Masai. For he was always
very friendly with them, and in his camp they were so well
regaled that it had become like the lion’s den of the fable:
all footsteps turning in and none out. A Masai runner, sent
with a letter to Lord Delamere’s camp, would never show
himself again with an answer. Lord Delamere, in the centre
of the stir, small, and exceedingly polite and courteous as
ever, his white hair down on his shoulders, seemed emi-
nently at ease here, told me everything about the war, and
offered me tea with smoked milk in it, after the Masai
fashion.

My people showed great forbearance with my ignorance
of oxen, harness and Safari ways; they were indeed as keen
to cover it up as I was myself. They worked well for me
all through the Safari, and never grumbled, although in my
inexperience I asked more of everyone, both men and oxen,
than could really be expected of them. They carried bath-
water for me on their heads a long way across the plain, and
when we outspanned at noon, they constructed a canopy
against the sun, made out of spears and blankets, for me to
rest under. They were a little scared of the wild Masai, and
much disturbed by the idea of the Germans, of whom
strange rumours went about. Under the circumstances I
"was to the expedition, I believe, a kind of Guardian Angel,
or mascot.

Six months before the outbreak of the war, I had first
come out to Africa, on the same boat as General von Let-
tow Vorbeck, who was now the highest in command of the
German forces in East Africa. I did not know then that he
was going to be a hero, and we had made friends on the
journey. When we dined together in Mombasa before he
went farther on to Tanganyika, and I went up-country, he
gave me a photograph of himself in uniform and on horse-
^back, and wrote on it:

“Dr/r Paradies aitf Erde
1st auf dem Rucken der PferdCy
Und die Gesundheit des Leibes
Am Busen des Weihes.^'^

Farah, who had come to meet me in Aden, and who had
seen the General and been aware that he was my friend, had
.taken the photograph with him on the Safari and kept it
with the money and the keys of the expedition to show to

271



OUT OF AFRICA

the German soldiers if we were made prisoners, and he at-
tached great value to it.

How beautiful were the evenings of the Masai Reserve
when after sunset we arrived at the river or the water-hole
where we were to outspan, travelling in a long file. The
plains with the thorntrees on them were already quite dark,
but the air was filled with clarity,— and over our heads, to
the West, a single star which was to grow big and radiant
in the course of the night was now just visible, like a silver
point in the sky of citrine topaz. The air was cold to the
lungs, the long grass dripping wet, and the herbs on it gave
out their spiced astringent scent. In a little while on all sides
die Cicada would begin to sing. The grass was me, and the
air, the distant invisible mountains were me, the tired oxen
were me. I breathed with the slight night-wind in the thorn-
trees.

After three months I was suddenly ordered home. As
things began to be systematically organized and regular
troops came out from Europe, my expedition, I believe, was
found to be somewhat irregular. We went back, passing our
old camping-places with heavy hearts.

This Safari lived for a long time in the memory rf the
farm. Later on I had many other Safaris, but for some rea-
son,— either because we had at the time been in the service
of the Government, a sort of Official ourselves, or because
of the war-like atmosphere about it,— this particular expedi-
tion was dear to the hearts of the people who had been on
\t. Those who had been with me then cane to look upon
themselves as a Safari-aristocracy.

Many years afterwards they would come up to the house
and talk about the Safari, just to freshen up their memory
of it, and to go through one or another of our adventures^
then.

THE SWAHELI NUMERAL SYSTEM

At the time when I was new in Africa, a shy young
Swedish dairy-man was to teach me the numbers in Swa-
heli. As the Swaheli word for nine, to Swedish ears, has a
dubious ring, he did not like to tell it to me, and when he
had counted: “seven, eight,” he stopped, looked away, and
said: “They have not got nine in Swaheli.”

“You mean,” I said, “that they can only count as far as
eight? ”

“Oh, no,” he said quickly. “They have got ten, eleven,
twelve, and so on. But they have not got nine.”

“Does that work?” I asked, wondering. “What do they
do when they come to nineteen?”

“They have not got nineteen either,” he said, blushing,
but very firm, “nor ninety, nor nine hundred,”~for these
words in Swaheli are constructed out of the number nine,~
“But apart from that they have got all our numbers.”

The idea of this system for a long time gave me much to
think of, and for some reason a great pleasure. Here, I
thought, was a people who have got originality of mind,
and courage to break with the pedantry of the numeral
series.

One, two and three are the only three sequential prime
numbers, I thought, so may eight and ten be the only se-
quential even numbers. People might try to prove the exist-
ence of the number of nine by arguing that it should be
possible to multiply the number of three with itself. But
why should it be so? If the number of two has got no
square root, the number of three may just as well be with-
out a square number. If you work out the sum of digits „of
a number until you reduce it to a single figure, it makes no
difference to the results if you have got the number of nine,

^3



OUT OF AFRICA


or any multiple of nine, in it from the beginning, so that
here nine may really be said to be non-existent, and that, I
thought, spoke for the Swaheli system.

It happened that I had at that time a houseboy, Zacharia,
who had lost the fourth finger of his left hand. Perhaps, I
thought, that is a common thing with Natives, and is done
to facilitate their arithmetic to them, when they are count-
ing upon their fingers.

When I began to develop my ideas to other people, I was
stopped, and enlightened. Yet I have still got the feeling
that there exists a Native system of numeral characters
without the number of nine in it, which to them works
weD and by which you can find out many things.

I have, in this connection, remembered an old Danish
clergyman who declared to me that he did not believe that
God had created the Eighteenth Century.

WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT
THOU BLESS Me”

When in Africa in March the long rains begin after four
months of hot, dry weather, the richness of growth and the
freshness and fragrance everywhere are overwhelming.

But the farmer holds back his heart and dares not trust to
the generosity of nature, he listens, dreading to hear a de-
crease in the roar of the falling rain. The water that the
earth is now drinking in must bring the farm, with all the
vegetable, animal and human life on it, through four rainless
months to come.

It is a lovely sight when the roads of the farm have all
been turned into streams of running water, and the farmer
wades through the mud with a singing heart, out to the
flowering and dripping coffee-fields. But it happens in the
274



FROM AN IMMIGRANT’S NOTEBOOK

middle of the rainy season that in the evening the stars show
themselves through the thinning clouds; then he stands out-
side his house and stares up, as if hanging himself on to the
sky to milk down more rain. He cries to the sky: ‘‘Give me
enough and more than enough. My heart is bared to thee
now, and I will not let thee go except thou bless me. Drown
me if you like, but kill me not with caprices. No coitus in-
termptus, heaven, heaven!”

Sometimes a cool, colourless day in the months after the
rainy season calls back the time of the marka mbaya, the
bad year, the time of the drought. In those days the Kikuyu
used to graze their cows round my house, and a boy
amongst them who had a flute, from time to time played a
short tune on it. When I have heard this tune again, it has
recalled in one single moment all our anguish and despair
of the past. It has got the salt taste of tears in it. But at the
same time I found in the tune, unexpectedly surprisingly,
a vigour, a curious sweetness, a song. Had those hard times
really had all these in them? There was youth in us then, a
wild hope. It was during those long days that we were all
of us merged into a unity, so that on another planet wx
shall recognise one another, and the things cry to each
other, the cuckoo clock and my books to the lean-fleshed
cows on the lawn and the sorrowful old Kikuyus: “You
also were there. You also were part of the Ngong farm.”
That bad time blessed us and went away.

The friends of the farm came to the house, and went
away again. They were not the kind of people who stay
for a long time in the same place. They were not the kind
of people either who grow old, they died and never came
back. But they had sat contented by the fire, and when the
house, closing round them, said: “I will not let you go ex-

275



OUT OF AFRICA


cept you bless me,” they laughed and blessed it, and it let
them go.

An old lady sat in a party and talked of her life. She de-
clared that she would like to live it all over again, and held
this fact to prove that she had lived wisely. I thought: Yes,
her life has been the sort of life that should really be taken
twice before you can say that you have had it. An arietta
you can take da capo, but not a whole piece of music,—
not a symphony and not a five-act tragedy either. If it is
taken over again it is because it has not gone as it ought to
have gone.

My life, I will not let you go except you bless me, but
then I will let you go.

THE ECLIPSE OF THE MOON

One year we had an eclipse of the moon. A short time
before it was to take place I had the following letter from
the young Indian Stationmaster of Kikuyu station: —

“Honoured Madam,— I have been kindly instructed that
the light of the sun is going to be put out for seven days
running. Leave alone the railway trains, I beg you kindly
inform me, as I believe that nobody else will kindly inform
me, whether during this period I shall leave my cows to
graze in the surroundings, or shall I collect them into the
stable?— I have the honour to be, Madam, Your obedient
servant. Patel.”


NATIVES and verse

The Natives, who have a strong sense of rhythm, know
nothing of verse, or at least did not know anything before
the times of the schools, where they were taught hymns.
276



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

One evening out in the maize-field, where we had been har-
vesting maize, breaking off the cobs and throwing them on
to the ox-carts, to amuse myself, I spoke to the field labour-
ers, who were mostly quite young, in Swaheli verse. There
was no sense in the verse, it was made for the sake of
the rhyme: -''Ngumbe na-penda chumbe, Malaya-mbaya.
Wakamba na-kula mamba.” The oxen like salt,— whores are
bad,— The Wakamba do eat snakes. It caught the interest of
the boys, they formed a ring round me. They were quick
to understand that the meaning in poetry is of no conse-
quence, and they did not question the thesis of the verse,
but waited eagerly for the rhyme, and laughed at it when it
came. I tried to make them themselves find the rhyme and
finish the poem when I had begun it, but they could not, or
would not, do that, and turned away their heads. As they
had become used to the idea of poetry, they begged: “Speak
again. Speak like rain.” Why they should feel verse to be
like rain I do not know. It must have been, however, an
expression of applause, since in Africa rain is always longed
for and welcomed.


OF THE MILLENNIUM

At the time when the near return of Christ to the earth
had become a certainty, a Committee was formed to decide
upon the arrangements for His reception. After some dis-
cussion, it sent out a circular which prohibited all waving
and throwing about of palm-branches as well as all cries of
“Hosanna.”

When the Millennium had been going on for some time^
and joy was universal, Christ one evening said to Peter that
He wanted, when everything was quiet, to go out for a
short walk with him alone.


277

“Where do you want to go, my Lord?’’ Peter asked.

“I should like,’’ answered the Lord, “just to take a walk

of Calvary,”


kitosch’s story

Kitosch’s story has been in the papers. A case rose from
it, and a jury was set to go through it from beginning to
end, searching for enlightenment; some of the enlighten-
ment will still be found in the old documents.

Kitosch was a young Native in the service of a young
white settler of Molo. One Wednesday in June, the settler
lent his brown mare to a friend, to ride to the station on.
He sent Kitosch there to bring back the mare, and told him
not to ride her, but to lead her. But Kitosch jumped on to
the mare, and rode her back, and on Saturday the settler,
his master, was told of the offence by a man who had seen
it. In punishment the settler, on Sunday afternoon, had
Kitosch flogged, and afterwards tied up in his store, and
here late on Sunday night Kitosch died.

Upon the matter the High Court was set in Nakuru, in
the Railway Institute, on the ist of August.

The Natives who gathered and sat round the Railway In-
stitute, will have been wondering what it was all about. To
their mind the case was plain, for Kitosch had died, of that
there was no doubt, and, according to Native ideas, a com-
pensation for his death should now be made to his people.

But the idea of justice of Europe varies from that of Af-
rica, and, to the jury of white men, the problem of guilt
and innocence at once presented itself. The verdict in the
case might be one of murder, of manslaughter, or of griev-
ous hurt. The Judge reminded the jury that the degree of
278



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

an offence rests upon the intentions of the persons con-
cerned, and not upon the results. What, then, had been the
intentions, and the attitude of mind, of the persons con-
cerned in the Kitosch case?

To decide upon the intention and attitude of mind of the
settler, the court had him cross-examined for many hours a
day. They were trying to make up a picture of what had
happened, and brought in all the details that they could lay
hands on. It is in this way written down that when the set-
tler called Kitosch, he came, and stood three yards away.
This insignificant detail in the report is of great effect. Here
they are at the opening of the drama, the white and the
black man, at three yards’ distance.

But from now on, as the story advances, the balance of
the picture is broken, and the figure of the settler is blurred
and grows smaller. It cannot be helped. It becomes only an
accessory figure in a great landscape, a pale puny face, it
loses its weight, and looks like a figure cut out in paper, and
it is blown about, as by a draught, by the unknown free-
dom to do what it likes.

The settler stated that he began by asking Kitosch who
had given him permission to ride the brown mare, and that
. he repeated this question forty to fifty times; he admitted
at the same time that nobody could possibly have given
Kitosch any such permission. Here his perdition begins. In
England he would not have been able to ask a question fort);
to fifty times, he would have been stopped, in one way or
the other, long before the fortieth time. Here in Africa
were people to whom he could shriek the same question
fifty times over. In the end Kdtosch answered that he was
not a thief, and the settler stated that it was as a result of
the insolence of the answer that he had the boy flogged.

At this point the report has got a second irrelevant, and

279



OUT OF AFRICA

effective, detail. It says that during the flogging, two Euro-
peans, who are designated as friends of the settler, came
over to see him. They looked on for ten minutes, or a quar-
ter of an hour, and walked away.

After the flogging the settler could not let Kitosch go.

Late in the evening, he tied Kitosch with a rein, and
locked him into his store. When the jury asked him why he
did so, he gave an answer that he had no sense, he said that
he wanted to keep such a boy from running about on the
farm. After supper, he went back to the store, and found
Kitosch lying unconscious a little way from where he had
tied him up, with the reins loosened. He called in his Ba-
ganda cook, and with his assistance tied up the boy tighter
than before, with his hands fastened to a post at his back,
and with his right leg tied to a post in front. He left the
store, locking the door, but half an hour later went back
there, got hold of his cook and the kitchen-Toto, and let
them into the store. Then he went to bed, and the next thing
he remembered, he said, was that the Toto came from the
store, and told him that Kitosch had died.

The jury kept in mind the words that the degree of an
offence rests upon the intention, and looked for an inten-
tion. They went into a number of detailed questions about ^
the flogging of Kitosch, and about what happened after, and
as you read the papers you seem to see them shake their
heads.

But what now had been the intention and the attitude of
mind of Kitosch? This, when gone into, was found to be a
different thing. Kitosch had had an intention, and in the end
it came to weigh in the scales of the case. It can be said that
by his intention, and his attitude of mind, the African, in his
grave, saved the European.

Kitosch had not much opportunity for expressing his in-
280



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

tention. He was locked up in the store, his message, there-
fore, comes very simply, and in a single gesture. The night-
watch states that he cried all night. But it was not so, for at
one o’clock he talked with the Toto, who was in the store
with him. He indicated to the child that he must shout to
him, because the flogging had made him deaf. But at one
o’clock he asked the Toto to loosen his feet, and explained
that in any case he could not run away. When the Toto
had done as he asked him, Kitosch said to him that he wanted
to die. At four, the child said, he again said that he wanted
to die. A little while after, he rocked himself from side to
side, cried: “I am dead!” and died.

Three doctors gave evidence in the case.

The District Surgeon, who had done the post mortem ex-
amination, pronounced death to be due to the injuries and
wounds that he had found on the body. He did not believe
that any immediate medical attention could have saved Kli-
tosch’s life.

The two doctors from Nairobi, called in for the defence,
were, however, of a different mind.

The flogging in itself, they held, was not sufficient to
have caused death. An important factor came into the mat-
ter, not to be ignored: that was the will to die. On this
point, the first doctor stated, he could speak with authority,
for he had been in the country twenty-five years, and knew
the Native mind. Many medical men could support him
that the wish to die, in a Native, had actually caused death.
In the present case the matter was particularly clear, for
Kitosch had himself said that he wanted to die. The second
doctor bore him up in this point of view.

It was very likely, the doctor now went on, that if Ki-
tosch had not taken this attitude, he would not have died.
If, for instance, he had eaten something, he might not have

281



OUT OF AFRICA

lost courage, for starvation is known to reduce courage. He
added that the wound on the lip might not be due to a kick,
but might be just a bite by the boy himself, in severe pain.

The doctor, furthermore, did not believe that Eatosch
would have made up his mind to die till after nine o’clock,
as by that time he seemed to have tried to escape. Neither
had he died till after nine o’clock. When he had been caught
in the attempt to escape, and had been tied up again, the
fact of being a prisoner, the doctor said, might have weighed
on his mind.

The two doctors from Nairobi summed up their view of
jhe case. The death of Kitosch, they held, was due to the
flogging, to starvation, and to the wish to die, the latter be-
ing the subject of special emphasis. The wish to die might,
they considered, have been caused by the effects of the
flogging.

After the doctors’ evidence, the case turned upon what
was called in Court ‘The wish-to-die theory.” The District
Surgeon, who was the only one who had seen Kitosch’s
body, rejected the theory, and gave examples of cancer
patients of his practice who had wished to die, but all the
same had not died. These people, however, were found to
have been Europeans.

The Jury in the end gave a verdict of: Guilty of grievous
hurt. The same verdict was applied to the Natives accused,
but it was considered that as they had acted under the or-
ders of their master, a European, it would be an injustice to
imprison them. The Judge imposed a sentence of two years
R.L on the settler, and of one day on each of the Natives.

It seems to you, as you read the case through, a strange,
a humiliating fact that the Europeans should not, in Africa,
have power to throw the African out of existence. The
country is his Native land, and whatever you do to him,
282



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK


when he goes he goes by his own free will, and because he
does not want to stay. Who is to take the responsibility for
what happens in a house? The man who owns it, who has
inherited it.

By this strong sense in him of what is right and decorous,
the figure of Kitosch, with his firm will to die, although
now removed from us by many years, stands out with a
beauty of its own. In it is embodied the fugitiveness of the
wild things who are, in the hour of need, conscious of a
refuge somewhere in existence; who go when they like; of
whom we can never get hold.

SOME AFRICAN BIRDS

Just at the beginning of the long rains, in the last week of
March, or the first week of April, I have heard the nightin-
gale in the woods of Africa. Not the full song: a few notes
only,— the opening bars of the concerto, a rehearsal, sud-
denly stopped and again begun. It was as if, in the solitude
of the dripping woods, some one was, in a tree, tuning a
small ’cello. It was, however, the same melody, and the same
abundance and sweetness, as were soon to fill the forests of
Europe, from Sicily to Elsinore.

We had the black and white storks in Africa, the birds
that build their nests upon the thatched village roofs of
Northern Europe. They look less imposing in Africa than
they do there, for here they had such tall and ponderous
birds as the Marabout and the Secretary Bird to be com-
pared to. The storks have got other habits in Africa than in
Europe, where they live as in married couples and are sym-
bols of domestic happiness. Here they are seen together in
big flights, as in clubs. They are called locust-birds in Af-
rica, and follow along when the locusts come upon the land,

283



OVT OF AFRICA

living high on them. They fly over the plains, too, where
there is a grass-fire on, circling just in front of the advanc-
ing line of small leaping flames, high up in the scintillating
rainbow-coloured air, and the grey smoke, on watch for the
mice and snakes that run from the fire. The storks have a
gay time in Africa. But their real life is not here, and when
the winds of spring bring back thoughts of mating and nest-
ing, their hearts are turned towards the North, they remem-
ber old times and places and fly off, two and two, and are
^shortly after wading in the cold bogs of their birth-places.

Out on the plains, in the beginning of the rains, where
the vast stretches of burnt grass begin to show fresh green
sprouting, there are many hundred plovers. The plains al-
ways have a maritime air, the open horizon recalls the Sea
and the long Sea-sands, the wandering wind is the same, the
charred grass has a saline smell, and when the grass is long
it runs in waves all over the land. When the white carnation
flowers on the plains you remember the chopping white-
specked waves all round you as you are tacking up the
Sund. Out on the plains the plovers likewise take on the ap-
pearance of Sea-birds, and behave like Sea-birds on a beach,
legging it, on the close grass, as fast as they can for a short
time, and then rising before your horse with high shrill
shrieks, so that the light sky is all alive with wings and birds’
voices.

The Crested Cranes, which come on to the newly rolled
and planted maize-land, to steal the maize out of the ground,
make up for the robbery by being birds of good omen, an-
nouncing the rain; and also by dancing to us. When the tall
birds are together in large numbers, it is a fine sight to see
them spread their wings and dance. There is much style in
the dance, and a little affectation, for why, when they can
fly, do they jump up and down as if they were held on to

284



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK


the earth by magnetism? The whole ballet has a sacred look^
like some ritual dance; perhaps the cranes are making an
attempt to join Heaven and earth like the winged angels
walking up and down Jacob’s Ladder. With rheir delicate
pale grey colouring, the little black velvet skull-cap and the
fan-shaped crown, the cranes have all the air of light, spir-
ited frescoes. When, after the dance, they lift and go away,
to keep up the sacred tone of the show they give out, by
the wings or the voice, a clear ringing note, as if a group of
church bells had taken to the wing and were sailing off.
You can hear them a long way away, even after the birds
themselves have become invisible in the sky: a chime from
the clouds.

The Greater Hornbill was another visitor to the farm,
and came there to eat the fruits of the Cape-Chestnut tree.
They are very strange birds. It is an adventure or an ex-
perience to meet them, not altogether pleasant, for they
look exceedingly knowing. One morning before sunrise I
was woken up by a loud jabbering outside the house, and
when I walked out on the terrace I saw forty-one Hornbills
sitting in the trees on the lawn. There they looked less like
birds than like some fantastic articles of finery set on the
trees here and there by a child. Black they all were, with
the sweet, noble black of Africa, deep darkness absorbed
through an age, like old soot, that makes you feel that for
elegance, vigour and vivacity, no colour rivals black. All
the Hornbills were talking together in the merriest mood,
but with choice deportment, like a party of inheritors after
a funeral. The morning air was as clear as crystal, the som-
bre party was bathing in freshness and purity, and, behind
the trees and the birds, the sun came up, a dull red ball. You
wonder what sort of a day you are to get after such an
early morning.

OUT OF AFRICA


The Flamingoes are the most delicately coloured of all
the African birds, pink and red like a flying twig of an Ole-
ander bush. They have incredibly long legs and bizarre and
recherche curves of their necks and bodies, as if from some
exquisite traditional prudery they were making all attitudes
md movements in life as difEcult as possible,

I once travelled from Port Said to Marseilles in a French
boat that had on board a consignment of a hundred and
fifty Flamingoes, which were going to the Jar din
climatation in Marseilles. They were kept in large dirty
cases with canvas sides, ten in each, standing up close to one
another. The keeper, who was taking the birds over, told
me that he was counting on losing wenty per cent, of them
on a trip. They were not made for that sort of life, in rough
weather they lost their balance, their legs broke, and the
other birds in the cage trampled on them. At night when the
wind was high in the Mediterranean and the ship came
down in the waves with a thump, at each wave I heard, in
the dark, the Flamingoes shriek. Every morning, I saw the
keeper taking out one or two dead birds, and throwing them
overboard. The noble wader of the Nile, the sister of the
lotus, which floats over the landscape like a stray cloud of
sunset, had become a slack cluster of pink and red feathers
with a pair of long, thin sticks attached to it. The dead
birds floated on the water for a short time, knocking up and
down in the wake of the ship before they sank.


PANIA

The Deerhounds, from having lived for innumerable gen-
erations with man, have acquired a human sense of humour,
and can laugh. Their idea of a joke is that of the Natives,
who are amused by things going wrong. Perhaps you can-
286



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

not get above this class of humour, until you also get an art^
and an established Church.

Pallia was Dusk’s son. I walked with him one‘‘day neai
the pond, where there was a row of tall, thin blue-gum
trees, when he ran away from me up to one of the trees and
came back again half-way, to make me come with him. I
went up to the tree, and saw a Serval-cat sitting high up in
it. The Serval-cats take your chickens, so that I shouted to
a Toto walking by, and sent him up to the house for my
gun, and when I had it brought, I shot the Serval-cat. She
came down from her great height with a thump, and Pania
was upon her in a second, shaking her and pulling her about,
very pleased with the performance.

Some time after I again came by the same road, past the
pond; I had been out to shoot partridge, but had got none,
and both Pania and I were downcast. All at once Pania flew
up to the farthest tree of the row, barking round it in a
state of the highest excitement, then rushed back to me, and
again back to the tree. I was pleased that I had got my gun
with me, and at the prospect of a second Serval-cat, for
they have got pretty, spotted skins, I ran up to the tree.
But, when I looked up, there was a black domestic cat sit-
ting, very angry, as high up as possible in the swaying top
of the tree. I lowered my gun. “Pania, ’’ I said, “you fool!
It’s a cat.”

As I turned round to Pania, he stood at a little distance,
looking at me and splitting his sides with laughter. When
his eyes met mine he rushed up to me, danced, wagged his
tail, whined, put his feet on my shoulders, and his nose to
my face, then jumped back again to give free course to his
laughter.

He expressed by pantomime: “I know. I know. It was a
tame cat. I knew all the time. Indeed, you must excuse me.

287



OUT OF AFRICA


But if you only knew the figure you cut, rushing up to a
tame cat with a gun!”

All that day, from time to time, he went through the
same agitation of mind, and the same behaviour, expressing
the most overwhelmingly friendly feelings towards me, and
then withdrawing a little to have an unhindered laugh.

An insinuating note came into his friendliness. “You know,”
he said, “that in this house it is only you and Farah that I
ever laugh at.”

Even in the evening when he was asleep, in front of the
fire, I heard him in his sleep groaning and whimpering a
little with laughter, I believe that he remembered the event
a long time after, when we passed the pond and the trees.

ESA^S DEATH

Esa, who was taken away from me during the war, after
the armistice came back and lived on the farm peacefully.
He had a wife by the name of Mariammo, a thin, black,
hard-working woman, who carried firewood to the house.
Esa was the gentlest servant I ever had, and quarrelled with

But something had happened to Esa in his exile, and he
had come back changed. Sometimes I was afraid that he
might imperceptibly die on me, like a plant that has had its
roots cut through.

Esa was my Cook, but he did not like to cook, he wanted
to be a gardener. Plants were the only things for which he
had preserved a real live interest. But while I had another
gardener I had no other Cook, and so held back Esa in the
kitchen. I had promised him that he should go back to his
garden-work, but I kept him off from month to month. Esa
on his own had dammed in a bit of ground by the river,
288




FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

and planted it as a surprise to me. But as he had been alone
at it, and was not a strong man, the dam was not solid
enough, and in the long rains it went aw^ay altogether.

The first disturbance of his quiet non-existence came upon
Esa when his brother died in the Kikuyu Reserve and left
him a black cow. By then it became evident how much Esa
had been sucked out by life, he could no longer stand up to
any strong manifestation of it. In particular, I believe, he
could not quite stand happiness. He asked me for three days’-
leave to go and fetch the cow, and, on his return, I saw
that he had been stirred and harassed, like the hands and
feet of people who have been benumbed by cold, and
brought into a warm room.

All Natives are gamblers, and under the illusion, created
by the black cow, that from now fortune was going to
smile on him, Esa began to develop a terrible confidence in
things, he had great dreams. He felt that life was before him
still; he decided to take a new wife. When he told me of
his plan, he was already negotiating with his future father-
in-law, who lived on the Nairobi road, and had a Swaheli
wife. I tried to make him change his mind. “You have got a
very good wife,” I said to him, “and your head is already
grey, you cannot be needing another. Stay with us now and
live in peace.” Esa took no offence at my arguments, the
little gentle Kikuyu stood up erect before me, and in his
vague way stuck to his decision. Shortly after, he brought
his new wife, Fatoma, to the farm.

That Esa should ever hope for any good to come from
his new marriage, showed that he had lost his judgment.
The bride was very young, hard, and sulky, dressed in the
Swaheli fashion, with the lasciviousness of her mother’s na-
tion, but with no gracefulness or gaiety in her. But Esa’s
face was radiant with triumph, and great plans; he was be-

289



OUT OF AFRICA

having, in his innocence, like a man on the verge of Gen-
eral Paralysis. Mariammo, the patient slave, kept in the
background, and seemed unconcerned.

It is possible that Esa had now a short time of greatnes!
and rejoicement, but it did not last, and his peaceful exist-
ence on the farm went to pieces through his new wife. A
month after the wedding she ran aw^ay from him, to live
with the Native soldiers in the barracks of Nairobi. For g
long time Esa used to ask for a day’s leave to go into town
and fetch her back, and in the evening returned with the
dark, reluctant girl. The first time he went confidently and
very decided, he would get her,— what about it, was she not
his lawful wife? Later he walked off in a bewildered, sad
research of his dreams and the smile of fortune.

“What do you want her back for, Esa?” I said to him.
“Let her go. She does not want to come back to you, and
no good will come from this.”

But Esa had not got it in him to let her go. Towards the
end he came down in his expectations of life, and it was
simply the monetary value of his woman that he sought to
retain. The other boys laughed at him, when he trudged off,
and told me that the soldiers laughed at him, too. But Esa
had never paid much attention to what other people thought
of him, and in any case he was past it now. He went in per-
sistently and faithfully to recover his lost property, as a
man will go in search of a runaway cow.

One morning Fatoma informed my houseboys that Esa
was sick, and could not cook that day, but he would be up
next day, she said. But late in the afternoon the boys came
in and told me that Fatoma had disappeared, and that Esa
had been poisoned and was dying. When I came out, they
had carried him, on his bed, out in the scjuare between the
boys’ huts. It was obvious that he had not got long to live.

290



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

He had been given some sort of Native poison, similar to
sriychnine, and must have suffered terribly in his hut, un-
der the eyes of the murderous young wife, until she felt
chat she had safely finished him, and had made off. He still
had a few spasms that contracted his body, but he was all
rigid and cold, like a dead man. His face was much changed,
and froth, mixed with blood, ran out from the corners of
his pale-blue mouth. Farah had gone to Nairobi in the car,
so that I could not get Esa in to the hospital, but I do not
think that I should have done that in any case; there was no
help for him.

Before he died Esa looked at me for a long time, but I do
not know if he recognized me. With the consciousness in
his dark, animal-like eyes now went the remembrance of
the country such as I had always wished to have known it,
when it had been like a Noah’s Ark, with the game all round
the little Native boy herding his father’s goats on the plain.
I held his hand, a human hand, a strong ingenious tool,
which had held weapons, planted vegetables and flowers,
caressed; which I had taught to make omelettes. Would Esa
himself hold his life to have been a success or a failure? It
would have been difKcult to tell. He had gone along his
own little, slow, twined paths and had been through many
things, always a peaceful man.

When Farah came home he took much trouble to have
Esa buried with the full orthodox ceremonial, for he had
been a pious Mohammedan. The Priest, whom w’-e called
out from Nairobi, could not come till next evening, so that
Esa’s funeral took place at night, with the Milky way on
the sky, and lamps in the funeral procession. Elis grave was
wailed up, in the Mohammedan way, under a big tree in
the forest. Mariammo now came forward and took her


291



OUT OF AFRICA

place amongst the mourners, and bewailed Esa loudly in the
night air.

Farah and I held a council as to what we ought to do
about Fatoma, and we decided to do nothing. It evidently
went against Farah to take steps to have a woman punished
by the law. I gathered from him that the Mohammedan law
does not hold a woman to account. Her husband is respon-
sible for what she does, and must pay the fine for what mis-
fortunes she causes, as he must pay the fine for what dam-
age his horse may do. But if the horse throws the owner
and kills him? Well yes, Farah agrees, that is a sad accident.
After all, Fatoma herself had had reason to complain about
her fate, now she would be left to fulfil it as she chose to, in
the barracks of Nairobi.

OF NATIVES AND HISTORY

The people who expect the Natives to jump joyfully from
the stone age to the age of the motor cars, forget the toil
and labour which our own fathers have had, to bring us all
through history up to where we are.

We can make motor-cars and aeroplanes, and teach the
Natives to use them. But the true love of motor-cars cannot
be made, in human hearts, in the turn of a hand. It takes cen-
turies to produce it, and it is likely that Socrates, the Cru-
sades, and the French Revolution, have been needed in the
making. We of the present day, who love our machines,
cannot c^uite imagine how people in the old days could live
without them. But we could not make the Athanasian Creed,
or the technique of the Mass, or of a five-act tragedy, and
perhaps not even of a sonnet. And if we had not found
them there ready for our use, we should have had to do
without them. Still we must imagine, since they have been
292



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

inade at all, that there was a time when the hearts of hu-
manity cried out for these things, and when a deeply felt
want was relieved when they were made.

Father Bernard came over on his motor bicycle one day,
his bearded face ail beaming with bliss and triumph, to
lunch with me, and to bring me tidings of great joy. The
day before, he told me, nine young Kikuyu, from the
Church of Scotland Mission, had come and asked to be re-
ceived into the Roman Catholic Church, because thev had,
upon meditation and discussions, come to hold with the doc-
trine of the Transubstantiation, of that Church.

All the people, whom I told of this happening, laughed
at Father Bernard, and explained that the young Kikuyus
had seen a chance of higher wages, or lighter work, or of
getting a bicycle to ride on, at the French Mission, and had
therefore invented their conversion in regard to the Transub-
stantiation. For we ourselves, they said, cannot understand
it, and we do not even like to think about it, so that to the
Kikuyu it must be altogether inadmissible. But it is not
quite sure that it is so; Father Bernard knew the Kikuyus
well. The minds of the young Kikuyu may now be walk-
ing on the shadowy paths of our own ancestors, whom we
should not disown in their eyes, who held their ideas about
the Transubstantiation very dear. Those people of five hun-
dred years ago, were in their day offered higher wages, and
promotion, and easier terms of life, even sometimes their
very lives, and to everything they preferred their convic-
tion about the Transubstantiation. They were not offered a
bicycle, but Father Bernard himself, who had got a motor
bicycle, attached less value to it than to the conversion of
the nine Kikuyus.

The modern white people in Africa believe in evolution
and not in any sudden creative act. They might then run

293



OUT OF AFRICA

the Natives through a short practical lesson of history tc
bring them up to where we are. We took these nations
over not quite forty years ago; if we compare that moment
to the moment of the birth of the Lord, and allow them, tc
catch up with us, three years to our hundred, it will now be
time to send them out Saint Francis of Assisi, and in a few
years Rabelais. They would love and appreciate both better
than we do, of our century. They liked Aristophanes when
some years ago I tried to translate to them the dialogue be-
tween the farmer and his son, out of “The Clouds.” In
uventy years they might be ready for the Encyclopaedists,
and then they would come, in another ten years, to Klip-
ling. We should let them have dreamers, philosophers and
poets out, to prepare the ground for Mr. Ford.

Where shall they find us then? Shall we in the meantime
have caught them by the tail and be hanging on to it, in
our pursuit of some shade, some darkness, practising upon
a tomtom? Will they be able to have our motor cars at cost
price then, as they can now have the doctrine of the Transub-
stantiation?


THE EARTHQUAKE

One year, about Christmas, we had an earthquake; it was
strong enough to turn over a number of native huts, it was
probably of the power of an angry elephant. It came in
three shocks, each of them lasted a few seconds, and there
was a pause of a few seconds in between them. These inter-
vals gave people time to form their ideas of the happening,
Denys Finch-Hatton, who was at the time camped in the
Masai Reserve, and was sleeping in his lorry, told me when
he came back, that as he was woken up by the shock he
thought, “A rhino has got underneath the lorry.” I myself

'94



FROM AN IMMIGRANT-^S NOTEBOOK

was in my bedroom going to bed when the earthquake
came. At the first tug I thought, leopard has got up on
the roof.” When the second shock came, I thought, “I am
going to die, this is how it feels to die.” But in the short
stillness between the second and the third shock, I realized
what it was, it was an earthquake, and I had never thought
that I should live to see that. For a moment now I believed
that the earthquake was over. But when the third and last
shock of it came, it brought with it such an overwhelming
feeling of joy that I do not remember ever in my life to
have been more suddenly and thoroughly transported.

The heavenly bodies, in their courses, have it in their power
to move human minds to unknown heights of delight. We
are not generally conscious of them; when their idea is sud-
denly brought back, and actualized to us, it opens up a tre-
mendous perspective. Kepler writes of what he felt when,
after many years’ work, he at last found the laws of the
movements of the planets:

“I give myself over to my rapture. The die is cast. Noth-
ing I have ever felt before is like this. I tremble, my blood
leaps. God has waited six thousand years for a looker-on to
his work. His wisdom is infinite, that of which we are ig-
norant is contained in him, as well as the little that wc
know.”

Indeed it was exactly the same transport which took hold
of me and shook me all through, at the time of the earth-
quake.

The feeling of colossal pleasure lies chiefly in the con-
sciousness that something which you have reckoned to be
immovable, has got it in it to move on its own. That is prob-
ably one of the strongest sensations of joy and hope in the
world. The dull globe, the dead mass, the Earth itself, rose
and stretched under me. It sent me out a message, the slight-

295



OUT OF AFRICA


est touch, but of unbounded significance. It laughed so th;
the Native huts fell down and cried: Eppur si maove.

Early next morning, Juma brought me my tea and saic
“The King of England is dead.”

I asked him how he knew.

“Did you not, Memsahib,” he said, “feel the earth tos
and shake last night? That means that the King of England
is dead.”

But luckily the King of England lived for many year
after the earthquake.

GEORGE

On a cargo-boat to Africa I once made friends with a lit-
tle boy named George, who was travelling out with hi
mother and his young aunt. One day, on the deck, he de-
tached himself from his women and, followed by their eyes,
walked up to me. He announced that it was his birthday
next day, he would be six years old, and his mother was go-
ing to ask the English passengers for tea, would I come, he
said?

“But I am not English, George,” said I.

“What are you?” he asked, in great surprise.

“I am a Hottentot,” I said.

He stood up straight, and looked at me very gravely.

“Never mind,” he said, “I hope you will come.”

He walked back to his mother and aunt and announced
to them in a nonchalant way, but with so much firmness
that it cut short any objection: “She is a Hottentot. But I
want her.”


KEJIKO

I once had a fat riding-mule that I had named Molly. The
xnule-Sice gave her another name, he called her Kejiko^
296



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

which means ‘‘the spoon,” and when I asked him why he
called her the spoon, he answered: “Because she looks like
a spoon.” I walked all round her to find out what he had in
his mind, but to me she did not look, from any side, the
least like a spoon.

Some time after I happened to be driving Kejiko, with
three other mules, in a cart. When I got up in the driver’s
high seat, I had a kind of bird’s eye view of the mules. Then
I saw that the Sice had been right. Kejiko was unusually
narrow across the shoulder and had broad plump hind-
quarters, she looked very much like a spoon with the
rounded side up.

If Kamau the Sice and I myself had each been painting a
portrait of Kejiko, the pictures would have been as differ-
ent as possible. But God and the angels would have seen her
as Kamau saw her. He that cometh from above is above all,
and what he hath seen that he testifieth.

THE GIRAFFES GO TO HAMBURG

I was staying in Mombasa in the house of Sheik Ali bin
Salim, the Lewali of the coast, a hospitable; chivalrous old
Arab gentleman.

Mombasa has all the look of a picture of Paradise, painted
by a small child. The deep Sea-arm round the island forms
an ideal harbour; the land is made out of whitish coral-cliff
grown with broad green mango trees and fantastic bald
grey Baobab trees. The Sea at Mombasa is as blue as a corn-
flower, and, outside the inlet to the harbour, the long break-
ers of the Indian Ocean draw a thin crooked white line, and
give out a low thunder even in the calmest weather. The
narrow-streeted town of Mombasa is all built from coral-
rock, in pretty shades of buff, rose and ochre, and above

297



OUT OF AFRICA

the town rises the massive old Fortress, with walls and em^
brasure, where three hundred years ago the Portuguese and
the Arabs held out against one another; it displays stronger
colours than the town, as if it had, in the course of the ages,
from its high site drunk in more than one stormy sunset.

The flamboyant red Acacia flowers in the gardens of
iMombasa, unbelievably intense of colour and delicate of
leaf. The sun burns and scorches Mombasa; the air is salt
here, the breeze brings in every day fresh supplies of brine
from the East, and the soil itself is salted so that very little
grass grows, and the ground is bare like a dancing-floor.
But the ancient mango trees have a dense dark-green foli-
age and give benignant shade; they create a circular pool of
black coolness underneath them. More than any other tree
that I know of, they suggest a place to meet in, a centre for
human intercourse; they are as sociable as the village-wells.
Big markets are held under the mango trees, and the ground
round their trunks is covered with hen-coops, and piled up
water-melons.

Ali bin Salim had a pleasant white house on the main-
land, at the curve of the Sea-arm, with a long row of stone
steps down to the Sea. There were guests’ houses alongside
it, and in the big room of the principal building, behind the
Verandah, there were collected many fine Arab and English
things: old ivory and brass, china from Lamu, velvet arm-
chairs, photographs, and a large gramophone. Amongst
these, inside a satin-lined casket, were the remnants of a full
tea-set in dainty English china of the ’forties, which had
been the wedding-present of the young Queen of England
and her Consort, when the Sultan of Zanzibar’s son married
the Shah of Persia’s daughter. The Queen and the Prince
had wished the married couple such happiness as they were
themselves enjoying.

298



FROM AN IMMIGRANT^ S NOTEBOOK

‘‘And were they as happy?” I asked Sheik Ali when he
took out the little cups, one by one, and placed them on the
table to show them to me.

“Alas no,” said he, “the bride would not give up riding.
She had brought her horses with her, on the dhow that
carried her trousseau. But the people of Zanzibar did not
approve of ladies riding. There was much trouble about it,
and, as the Princess would sooner give up her husband than
her horses, in the end the marriage was dissolved and the
Shah’s daughter went back to Persia.”

In the harbour of Mombasa lay a rusty German cargo-
steamer, homeward bound. I passed her in Ali bin Salim’s
rowing boat with his Swaheli rowers, on my way to the
island and back. Upon the deck there stood a tall wooden
case, and above the edge of the case rose the heads of two
Giraffes. They were, Farah, who had been on board the
boat, told me, coming from Portuguese East Africa, and
were going to Hamburg, to a travelling Menagerie.

The Giraffes turned their delicate heads from the one
side to the other, as if they were surprised, which they
might well be. They had not seen the Sea before. They
could only just have room to stand in the narrow case. The
world had suddenly shrunk, changed and closed round them.

They could not know or imagine the degradation to
which they were sailing. For they were proud and innocent
creatures, gentle amblers of the great plains; they had not
the least knowledge of captivity, cold, stench, smoke, and
mange, nor of the terrible boredom in a world in which
nothing is ever happening.

Crowds, in dark smelly clothes, will be coming in from the
wind and sleet of the streets to gaze on the Giraffes, and to
realize man’s superiority over the dumb world. They will
point and laugh at the long slim necks when the graceful,

299



OUT OF AFRICA

patient, srnoky-eyed heads are raised over the railings of the
menagerie; they look much too long in there. The children
will be frightened at the sight and cry, or they will fall in
love with the Giraffes, and hand them bread. Then the
fathers and mothers will think the Giraffes nice beasts, and
believe that they are giving them a good time.

In the long years before them, will the Giraffes some-
times dream of their lost country? Where are they now,
where have they gone to, the grass and the thorn-trees, the
rivers and water-holes and the blue mountains? The high
sweet air over the plains has lifted and withdrawn. AVhere
have the other Giraffes gone to, that were side by side with
them when they set going, and cantered over the undulating
land? They have left them, they have all gone, and it seems
that they are never coming back.

In the night where is the full moon?

The Giraffes stir, and wake up in the caravan of the Me-
nagerie, in their narrow box that smells of rotten straw and
beer.

Good-bye, good-bye, I wish for you that you may die
on the journey, both of you, so that not one of the little
noble heads, that are now raised, surprised, over the edge of
the case, against the blue sky of Mombasa, shall be left to
turn from one side to the other, all alone, in Hamburg,
where no one knows of Africa.

As to us, we shall have to find someone badly transgress-
ing against us, before we can in decency ask the Giraffes to
forgive us our transgressions against them.


IN THE MENAGERIE

About a hundred years ago, a Danish traveller to Ham-
burg, Count Schimmelmann, happened to come upon a



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

small itinerant Menagerie, and to take a fancy to it. While
he was in Hamburg, he every day set his way round the
place, although he would have found it difficult to explain
what was to him the real attraction of the dirty and dilapi-
dated caravans. The truth w^as that the Menagerie responded
to something within his own mind. It w'as winter and bit-
terly cold outside. In the sheds the keeper had been heating
the old stove until it was a clear pink in the brown darkness
of the corridor, alongside the animals’ cages, but still the
draught and the raw air pierced people to the bone.

Count Schimmelmann was sunk in contemplation of the
Hyena, when the proprietor of the Menagerie came and ad-
dressed him. The proprietor was a small pale man with a
fallen-in nose, who had in his days been a student of theol-
ogy, but who had had to leave the faculty after a scandal,
and had since step by step come down in the world.

“Your Excellency does well to look at the Hyena,” said
he. “It is a great thing to have got a Hyena to Hamburg,
where there has never been one till now. All Hyenas, you
will know, are hermaphrodites, and in Africa, where they
come from, on a full-moon night they will meet and join
in a ring of copulation wherein each individual takes the
double part of male and female. Did you know that?”

“No,” said Count Schimmelmann with a slight move-
ment of disgust.

“Do you consider now. Your Excellency,” said the show-
man, “that it should be, on account of this fact, harder to
a Hyena than to other animals to be shut up by itself in a
cage? Would he feel a double want, or is he, because he
unites in himself the complementary qualities of creation,
satisfied in himself, and in harmony? In other words, since
we are all prisoners in life, are we happier, or more miser-
able, the more talents we possess?”


30i



OUT OF AFRICA

“It is a curious thing,” said Count Schimmelmann, who
had been following his own thoughts and had not paid at-
tention to the showman, “to realize that so many hundred,
indeed thousands of Hyenas should have lived and died, in
order that we should, in the end, get this one specimen
here, so that people in Hamburg shall be able to know what
a Hyena is like, and the naturalists to study from them.”

They moved on to look at the Giraffes in the neighbour-
ing cage.

“The wild animals,” continued the Count, “which run in
a wild landscape, do not really exist. This one, now, exists,
we have got a name for it, we know what it is like. The
others might as well not have been, still they are the large
majority. Nature is extravagant.”

The showman pushed back his worn fur-cap, underneath
it he himself had not got a hair on his head. “They see one
another,” he said.

“Even that may be disputed,” said Count Schimmelmann
after a short pause* “These Giraffes, for instance, have got
square markings on the skin. The Giraffes, looking at one
another, will not know a square and will consequently not
see a square. Can they be said to have seen one another
at aU?”

The showman looked at the Giraffe for some time and
then said: “God sees them.”

Count Schimmelmann smiled. “The Giraffes?” he asked.

“Oh yes, your Excellency,” said the showman, “God sees
the Giraffes. While they have been running about and have
played in Africa, God has been watching them and has
taken a pleasure in their demeanour. He has made them to
please him. It is in the Bible, your Excellency,” said the
showman. “God so loved the Giraffe that He created them.
God has Himself invented the square as well as the circle,
302

surely your Excellency cannot deny that, He has seen the
squares on their skin and everything else about them. The
wild animals, your Excellency, are perhaps a proof of the
existence of God, But when they go to Hamburg,” he con-
cluded, putting on his cap, “the argument becomes prob-
lematic.”

Count Schimmelmann who had arranged his life accord-
ing to the ideas of other people, walked on in silence to
look at the snakes, close to the stove. The showman, to
amuse him, opened the case in which he kept them, and
tried to make the snake within it wake up; in the end, the
reptile slowly and sleepily wound itself round his arm.
Count Schimmelmann looked at the group.

“Indeed, my good Kannegieter,” he said with a little
surly laugh, “if you were in my service, or if I were kin g
and you my minister, you would now have your dismissal.”

The showman looked up at him nervously. “Indeed, Sir,
should I?” he said, and slipped down the snake into the case.
“And why. Sir? If I may ask so,” he added after a moment.

“Ah, Kannegieter, you are not so simple as you make
out,” said the Count. “Why? Because, my friend, the aver-
sion to snakes is a sound human instinct, the people who
have got it have kept alive. The snake is the deadliest of all
the enemies of men, but what, except our own instinct of
good and evil, is there to tell us so? The claws of the lions,
the size, and the tusks, of the Elephants, the horns of the
Buffaloes, all jump to the eye. But the snakes are beautiful
animals. The snakes are round and smooth, like the things
we cherish in life, of exquisite soft colouring, gentle in all
their movements. Only to the godly man this beauty and
gracefulness are in themselves loathsome, they smell from
perdition, and remind him of the fall of man. Something
within him makes him run away from the snake as from the

303



OUT OF AFRICA

devil, and that is what is called the voice of conscience. The
man who can caress a snake can do anything.’’ Count Schim-
melmann laughed a little at his own course of thoughts, but-
toned his rich fur-coat, and turned to leave the shed.

The showman had stood for a little while in deep thoughts.
“Your Excellency,” he said at last, “you must needs love
snakes. There is no way round it. Out of my own experi-
ence in life, I can tell you so, and indeed it is the best advice
that I can give you: You should love the snakes. Keep in
your mind, your Excellency, how often,— keep in mind,
your Excellency, that nearly every time that we ask the
L-rord for a fish, he will give us a serpent.”

FELLOW-TRAVELLERS

At the table on the boat to Africa I sat between a Belgian
going to the Congo, and an Englishman who had been eleven
times to Mexico to shoot a particular kind of wild mountain-
sheep, and who was now going out to shoot bongo. In making
conversation on both sides, I got mixed up in the lan-
guages, and when I meant to ask the Belgian if he had trav-
elled much in his life, I asked him: Avez-vous beaucoup
iravaille dans votre vie? He took no offence but, drawing out
his tooth-pick, he answered gravely: Enormement^ Madame.
From this time he made it his object to tell me of all the
labours of his life. In everything that he discussed, a certain
expression came back: Notre mission. Notre grande mission
dans le Congo.

One evening, as we were going to play cards, the Eng-
lish traveller told us about Alexico and of how a very old
Spanish lady, who lived on a lonely farm in the mountains,
when she heard of the arrival of a stranger, had sent for
304



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

him and ordered him to give her the news of the world,
“Well, men fly now, Madame,” he said to her.

“Yes, I have heard of that,” said she, “and I have had
many arguments with my priest about it. Now you can en-
lighten us, sir. Do men fly with their legs drawn up under
them, like the sparrows, or stretched out behind them, like
the storks?”

He also, in the course of our talk, made a remark about
the ignorance of the Natives of Mexico, and of the schools
there. The Belgian, who was dealing, paused with the last
card in his hand, looked piercingly at the Englishman, and
said: II faut enseigner aux negres a etre honnetes et a travail-
ler. Rien de plus. Laying down the card with a bang on the
table, he repeated with great determination: Rien de plus.
Rien. Rien. Rien.

THE NATURALIST AND THE MONKEYS

A Swedish Professor of Natural History came out to the
farm to ask me to intervene for him with the Game-
Department. He had come to Africa, he told me, to find
out at what phase of the embryo state the foot of the mon-
keys, that has got a thumb to it, begins to diverge from the
human foot. For this purpose he meant to go and shoot
Colobus monkeys on Mount Elgon.

“You will never find out from the Colobus monkeys,” I
said to him, “they live in the tops of the cedar trees, and are
shy and difficult to shoot. It would be the greatest luck
should you get the embryo you w^ant.”

The Professor was hopeful, he was going to stay out till
he had got his foot, he said, even if it was to be for years.
He had applied to the Game-Department for permission to
shoot the monkeys he wanted. The permission he was, in

305



OUT OF AFRICA

view of the high scientific object of his expedition, certain
to get, but so far he had had no reply.

^‘How many monkeys have you asked to be allowed to
shoot?” I asked him.

He told me that he had, to begin with, asked for permis-
sion to shoot fifteen hundred monkeys.

Now I knew the people at the Game Department, and I
assisted him to send in a second letter, asking for a reply by
return of post, since the Professor was keen to get off on
his research. The answer from the Game Department did,
for once, come by return of post. The Game Department,
they wrote, were pleased to inform Professor Landgreen
that, in view of the scientific object of his expedition, they
had seen their way to make an exception from their rules,
and to raise the number of monkeys on his license from
four to six.

I had to read the letter over twice to the Professor. When
the contents at last were clear to him, he became so down-
cast, so deadly shocked and hurt, that he did not say a single
word. To my expressions of condolence he made no reply,
but walked out of the house, got into his car and drove
away sadly.

When things did not go so much against him, the Pro-
fessor was an entertaining talker, and a humorist. In the
course of our debates about the monkeys he enlightened
me upon various facts and developed many of his ideas to
me. One day he said: “I will tell you of a highly interesting
experience of mine. Up at Mount Elgon, I found it possible
to believe for a moment in the existence of God, what do
you think of that?”

I said that it was interesting, but I thought: There is an-
other interesting question which is, -Has it been possible to
306



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

God, at Mount Elgon, to believe for a moment in the exist-
ence of Professor Landgreen?


KAROMENYA

There was on the farm a little boy of nine named Karo-
menya who was deaf and dumb. He could give out a sound,
a sort of short, raw roar, but it was very rare and he did not
like it himself, but always stopped it at once, panting a few
times. The other children were afraid of him and com-
plained that he beat them. I first made Karomenya’s ac-
quaintance when his playfellows had knocked him on the
head with the branch of a tree, so that his right cheek was
thick, and festering with splinters that had to be dug out
with a needle. This was not such a martyrdom to Karo-
menya as one would have thought; if it did hurt him, it also
brought him into contact with people.

Karomenya was very dark, with fine moist black eyes
and thick eyelashes; he had an earnest grave expression and
hardly ever a smile on his face, and altogether much of the
look of a small black Native bull-calf. He was an active,
positive creature, and as he was cut off from communicat-
ing with the world by speech, fighting to him had become
the manifestation of his being. He was also very good at
throwing stones, and could place them where he wanted
with great accuracy. At one time Karomenya had a bow
and arrow, but it did not work well with him, as if an ear
for the ring of the bow-string were, by necessity, part of
the archer’s craft. Karomenya was sturdily built and very
strong for his age. He would probably not have exchanged
these advantages over the other boys for their faculty of
speech and hearing, for which, I felt, he had no particular
admiration.


307



OUT OF AFRICA

Karomenya, in spite of his fighting spirit, was no un-
friendly person. If he realized that you were addressing
him, his face at once lightened up, not in a smile but in a
prompt resolute alacrity. Karomenya was a thief, and took
sugar and cigarettes when he saw his chance, but he im-
mediately gave away the stolen goods to the other children.
I once came upon him as he was dealing out sugar to a
circle of boys, himself in the centre, he did not see me, and
that is the only time when I have seen him come near to
laughing.

I tried, for a time, to give Karomenya a job in the kitchen
or in the house, but he failed in the offices, and was himself,
after a while, bored with the work. What he liked, was to
move heavy things about, and to drag them from one place
to another. I had a row of white-washed stones along my
drive, and, with his assistance, I one day moved one of them
and rolled it all the way up to the house, to make the drive
symmetrical. The next day, while I was out, Karomenya
had taken up all the stones and had rolled them up to the
house in a great heap, and I could never have believed that
a person of his size would have been capable of that. It must
have cost him a terrible effort. It was as if Karomenya knew
his place in the world and stuck to it. He was deaf and
dumb, but he was very strong.

Karomenya, most of all things in the world, wanted a
knife, but I dared not give him one, for I thought that he
might easily, in his striving for contact with other people,
have killed one or more of the other children on the farm
with it. He will have got one, though, later in life; his desire
was so vehement, and God knows what use he has made
of it.

The deepest impression I made on Karomenya was when
I gave him a whistle. I had myself used it for some time to
308



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

call in the dogs. When I showed it to him he took very
little interest in it; then, as on my instruction he put it to
his mouth and blew it, and the dogs, from both sides, came
rushing at him, it gave him a great shock, his face darkened
with surprise. He tried it once more, found the effect to be
the same, and looked at me. A severe bright glance. When
he got more used to the whistle, he wanted to know how it
worked. He did not, to this purpose, look at the whistle it-
self, but when he had whistled for the dogs and they came,
he scrutinized them with knit brows as if to find out where
they had been hit. After this time Karomenya took a great
liking to the dogs, and often, so to say, had the loan of
them, taking them out for a walk. I used, when he walked
off with them on a lead, to point to the place in the West-
ern sky where the sun should be standing by the time that
he must be back, and he pointed to the same place, and was
always very punctual.

One day, as I was out riding, I saw Karomenya and the
dogs a long way away from my house, in the Masai Re-
serve. He did not see me, but thought that he was all on his
own and unobserved. Here he let the dogs have a run, and
then whistled them in, and he repeated the performance
three or four times, while I watched him from my horse.
Out on the plain, where he thought that nobody knew, he
gave himself up to a new idea and aspect of life.

He carried his whistle on a string round his neck, but one
day he had not got it. I asked him by pantomime what had
become of it, and he answered by pantomime that it was
gone,— lost. He never asked me for another whistle. Either
he thought that a second whistle was not to be had, or else
he meant, now, to keep away altogether from something in
life that was not really his affair. I am not even sure that he

309



OUT OF AFRICA


had not thrown away the whistle himself, unable to recon-
cile it with his other ideas of existence.

In five or six years, Karomenya is either to go through
much suffering, or he will suddenly be lifted into heaven.


POORAN SINGH

Pooran Singh’s little blacksmith’s shop down by the mill
Was a miniature Hell on the farm, with all the orthodox
attributes of that place. It was built of corrugated iron, and
when the sun shone down upon the roof of it, and the
flames of the furnace rose inside it, the air itself, in and
around the hut, was white-hot. All day long, the place re-
sounded with the deafening noise of the forge,— iron on
iron, on iron once more,— and the hut was filled with axes,
and broken wheels, that made it look like some ancient
gruesome picture of a place of execution.

All the same the blacksmith’s shop had a great power of
attraction, and when I went down to watch Pooran Singh
at work I always found people in it and round it. Pooran
Singh worked at a superhuman pace, as if his life depended
upon getdng the particular job of work finished within the
next five nunutes, he jumped straight up in the air over the
forge, he shrieked out his orders to his two young Kikuyu
assistants in a high bird’s voice and behaved altogether like
a man who if himself being burnt at the stake, or like some
chafed over-devil at work. But Pooran Singh was no devil,
but a person of the meekest disposition; out of working hours
he had a little maidenly affectation of manner. He was our
Fundee of the farm, which means an artisan of all work,
carpenter, saddler and cabinet-maker, as well as blacksmith;
he constructed and built more than one waggon for the
farm, all on his own. But he liked the work of the forge
310



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

best, and it was a very fine, proud sight, to watch him tiring
a wheel.

Pooran Singh, in his appearance, was something of a
fraud. When fully dressed, in his coat and large folded
white turban, he managed, with his big black beard, to look
a portly, ponderous man. But by the forge, bared to the
waist, he was incredibly slight and nimble, with the Indian
hour-glass torso.

I liked Pooran Singh’s forge, and it was popular with the
Kikuyus, for two reasons.

First, because of the iron itself, which is the most fasci-
nating of all raw materials, and sets people’s imagination
travelling on long tracks. The plough, the sword and can-
non and the wheel,— the civilization of man— man’s conquest
of Nature in a nut, plain enough to be understood or
guessed by the primitive people,— and Pooran Singh ham-
mered the iron.

Secondly, the Native world was drawn to the forge by its
song. The treble, sprightly, monotonous, and surprising
rhythm of the blacksmith’s work has a mythical force. It is
so virile that it appals and melts the women’s hearts, it is
straight and unaffected and tells the truth and nothing but
the truth. Sometimes it is very outspoken. It has an excess of
strength and is gay as well as strong, it is obliging to you
and does great things for you, willingly, as in play. The
Natives, who love rhythm, collected by Pooran Singh’s hut
and felt at their ease. According to an ancient Nordic law a
man was not held responsible for what he had said in a forge.
The tongues were loosened in Africa as well, in the black-
smith’s shop, and the talk flowed freely; audacious fancies
were set forth to the inspiring hammer-song.

Pooran Singh was with me for many years and was a
well-paid functionary of the farm. There was no propor-

311



OUT OF AFRICA

tion between his wages and his needs, for he was an ascetic
of the first water. He did not eat meat, he did not drink, or
smoke, or gamble, his old clothes were worn to the thread.
He sent his money over to India for the education of his
children. A small silent son of his. Delip Singh, once came
over from Bombay on a visit to his father. He had lost
touch with the iron, the only metal that I saw about him
was a fountain pen in his pocket. The mythical qualities
were not carried on in the second generation.

But Pooran Singh himself, raging above the forge, kept
his halo as long as he was on the farm, and I hope as long as
he lived. He was the servant of the gods, heated through,
white-hot, an elemental spirit. In Pooran Singh’s black-
smith’s shop the hammer sang to you what you wanted to
hear, as if it was giving voice to your own heart. To me
myself the hammer was singing an ancient Greek verse,
which a friend had translated:

‘Tros struck out, like a smith with his hammer.

So that the sparks flew from my defiance.

He cooled my heart in tears and lamentations.

Like red-hot iron in a stream.”

A STRANGE HAPPENING

When I was down in the Masai Reserve, doing transport
for the Government, I one day saw a strange thing, such as
no one I know has ever seen. It took place in the middle of
the day, while we were trekking over grass-country.

The air in Africa is more significant in the landscape than
in Europe, it is filled with loomings and mirages, and is in a
way the real stage of activities. In the heat of the midday
the air oscillates and vibrates like the string of a violin, lifts
312



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK

Up long layers of grass-land with thorn-trees and hills on it,
and creates vast silvery expanses of water in the dry grass.

We were walking along in this burning live air, and I
was, against my habit, a long w^ay in front of the waggons,
with Farah, my dog Dusk and the Toto who looked after
Dusk. We were silent, for it was too hot to talk. All at once
the plain at the horizon began to move and gallop with
more than the atmosphere, a big herd of game was bearing
down upon us from the right, diagonally across the stage.

I said to Farah: ‘‘Look at all these Wildebeests.” But a lit-
tle after, I was not sure that they were Wildebeests; I took
up my field-glasses and looked at them, but that too is diffi-
cult in the middle of the day. “Are they Wildebeests, Farah,
do you think?” I asked him.

I now saw that Dusk had all his attention upon the ani-
mals, his ears up in the air, his far-seeing eyes following
their advance. I often used to let him have a run after the
gazelles and antelopes on the plains, but to-day I thought
that it would be too hot, and told the Toto to fasten his lead
to his collar. At that same moment, Dusk gave a short wild
yell and jumped forward so that the Toto was thrown over,
and I snatched the lead myself and had to hold him with all
my might. I looked at the game. “What are they?” I asked
Farah.

It is very difficult to judge distances on the plains. The
quivering air and the monotony of the scenery make it so,
also the character of the scattered thorn-trees, which have
the exact shape of mighty old forest trees, but are in reality
only twelve feet high, so that the Giraffes raise their heads
and necks above them. You are continually deceived as to
the size of the game that you see at a distance and may, in
the middle of the day, mistake a jackal for an Eland, and an

313



OUT OF AFRICA

ostrich for a Buffalo. A minute later Farah said: “Memsahib,
these are wild dogs.”

The wild dogs are generally seen three or four at a time,
but it happens that you meet a dozen of them together. The
Natives are afraid of them, and will tell you that they are
very murderous. Once as I was riding in the Reserve close
to the farm I came upon four wild dogs which followed me
at a distance of fifteen yards. The two small terriers that I
had with me then kept as close to me as possible, actually
under the belly of the pony, until we came across the river
and on to the farm. The wild dogs are not as big as a
Hyena. They are about the size of a big Alsatian dog. They
are black, with a white tuft at the tip of the tail and of the
pointed ears. The skin is no good, it has rough uneven hair
and smells badly.

Here there must have been five hundred wild dogs. They
came along in a slow center, in the strangest way, looking
neither right nor left, as if they had been frightened by
something, or as if they were travelling fast with a fixed
purpose on a track. They just swerved a bit as they came
nearer to us; all the same they hardly seemed to see us, and
went on at the same pace. When they were closest to us,
they were fifty yards away. They were running in a long
file, two or three or four side by side, it took time before
the whole procession had passed us. In the middle of it,
Farah said: ‘"These dogs ar^ very tired, they have run a
long way.”

When they had all gone by, and were disappearing again,
we looked round for the Safari. It was still some way be-
hind us, and exhausted by our agitation of mind we sat
down where we stood in the grass, until it came up to us.
Dusk was terribly upset, jerking his lead to nm after the
wild dogs. I took him round the neck, if I had not tied him

314



FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK


up in time, I thought, he would by now have been eaten up.

The drivers of the waggons detached themselves from
the Safari and came running up to us, to ask us what it had
all been. I could not explain to them, or to myself, what had
made the wild dogs come along in so great a number in
such a way. The Natives all took it as a very bad omen,— an
omen of the war, for the wild dogs are carrion-eaters. They
did not afterwards discuss the happening much among them-
selves, as they used to discuss all the other events of the
Safari.

I have told this tale to many people and not one of them
has believed it. All the same it is true, and my boys can
bear me witness.


THE PARROT

An old Danish shipowner sat and thought of his young
days and of how he had, when he was sixteen years old,
spent a night in a brothel in Singapore. He had come in
there with the sailors of his father’s ship, and had sat and
talked with an old Chinese woman. When she heard that he
was a native of a distant country she brought out an old
parrot, that belonged to her. Long, long ago, she told him,
the parrot had been given her by a high-born English lover
of her youth. The boy thought that the bird must then be a
hundred years old. It could say various sentences in the lan-
guages of all the world, picked up in the cosmopolitan at-
mosphere of the house. But one phrase the old China-
woman’s lover had taught it before he sent it to her, and
that she did not understand, neither had any visitor ever
been able to tell her what it meant. So now for many years
she had given up asking. But if the boy came from far away
perhaps it was his language, and he could interpret the
phrase to her.


315



OUT OF AFRICA

The boy had been deeply, strangely moved at the sug-
gestion. When he looked at the parrot, and thought that he
might hear Danish from that terrible beak, he very nearly
ran out of the house. He stayed on only to do the old Chi-
nese woman a service. But when she made the parrot speak
its sentence, it turned out to be classic Greek. The bird
spoke its words very slowly, and the boy knew enough
Greek to recognize it; it w^as a verse from Sappho:

“The moon has sunk and the Pleiads,

And midnight is gone,

And the hours are passing, passing.

And I lie alone.”

The old woman, when he translated the lines to her,
smacked her lips and rolled her small slanting eyes. She
asked him to say it again, and nodded her head.


316






OUT OF AFRICA

I thought out many devices for the salvation of the farm.
One year I tried to grow flax on our spare land. Flax-
growing is a lovely job, but it needs much skill and experi-
ence. I had a Belgian refugee to give me advice on it, and
when he asked me how much land I meant to plant, and I
told him three hundred acres, he immediately exclaimed:

Madame^ c^est hnpossibleJ" I might grow five acres or
even ten with success he said, but no more. But ten acres
would take us nowhere, and I put in a hundred and fifty
acres. A sky-blue flowering flax-field is a marvellously pretty
sight,— like a piece of Heaven on earth and there can be no
more gratifying kind of goods to be turning out than the
flax fibre, tough and glossy, and slightly greasy to the
touch. You follow it in your thoughts as it is sent away,
and imagine it made into sheets and nightgowns. But th?e
Kikuyu could not, in the turn of a hand and without con-
stant supervision, be taught to be accurate enough in the
pulling and retting and scutching of it; and so my flax-
growing was no success.

Most of the farmers in the country were, in those years,
trying their hand at some such scheme, and to a few of
them in the end an inspiration came. Things turned out
well for Ingrid Lindstrom of Njoro: at the time when I had
left the country, and after she had slaved for twelve years
at her market-gardening, pigs, turkeys, castor-oil bushes,
and soya-beans, had seen them all fail, and wept over them,
she saved her farm for her family and herself by planting
pyrethrum, which is sent to France and is there used in
making perfumes. But I myself had no luck with my experi-
ments, and when the dry weather and the wind from the
Athi plain5 set in, the coffee-trees drooped and the leaves
turned yeUow; on parts of the farm we got bad coffee-
diseases like thrips and antestia.

^20



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

To bring the coffee on we tried to manure the fields. It
had always, as I had been brought up with European ideas
on farming, gone against me to take the crops out of the
land, without manuring. When the squatters of the farm
heard of the project they came forward to help me, and
brought out, from their cattle and goat bomas, the manure
of decades. It was delicate peaty stuff that was easy to han-
dle. We ploughed up a furrow between the rows of coffee-
trees, with the small new ploughs with a single ox to them
that we had bought in Nairobi, and, since we could not get
a cart into the fields, the women of the farm carried the
manure in sacks on their backs, and spread it in the furrow,
a sack to the tree, so that we could lead back the oxen and
ploughs, and cover it up. It was pleasant work to watch,
and I expected great things from it, but as it came to hap-
pen, no one ever saw the effects of the manuring.

Our real trouble was that we were short of capital, for it
had all been spent in the old days before I took over the
running of the farm. We could not carry through any radi-
cal improvements, but had to live from hand to mouth,—
and this, in the last years, became our normal mode of liv-
ing on the farm.

If I had had the capital, I thought, I would have given up
coffee, have cut down the coffee-trees, and have planted
forest-trees on my land. Trees grow up so quickly in
Africa, in ten years’ time you walk comfortably under tall
blue gum trees, and wattle trees, which you have yourself,
in the rain, carried in boxes from the nurseries, twelve trees
in a box. I would have had then, I reflected, a good market
for both timber and firewood in Nairobi. It is a noble occu-
pation to plant trees, you think of it many years after with
content. There had been big stretches of Native forest on
the farm in the old days, but it had been sold to the Indians

321



OUT OF AFRICA

for cutting down, before I took over the farm; it was a sad
thing. I myself in the hard years had had to cut down the
wood on my land round the factory for the steam-engine,
and this forest, with the tall stems and the live green shad-
ows in it had haunted me, I have not felt more sorry for
anything I have done in my life, than for cutting it down.
From time to time, when I could afford it, I planted up bits
of land with Eucalyptus trees, but it did not come to much.
It would be, in this way, fifty years before I had got the
many hundred acres planted up, and had changed the farm
into a singing wood, scientifically run, with a saw-mill by
the river. The Squatters of the farm, though, whose ideas of
time were different from those of the white people, kept on
looking forward hopefully to the time when everybody
would have abundance of firewood,--such as the people had
had in the old days, -from the forest that I was now soon
going to plant.

I had also plans of keeping cattle and running a dairy, on
the farm. We were situated in an unclean area, which means
that you have got East Coast fever on the land, and that if
you will keep Grade stock you have got to dip your cattle.
It makes it harder to compete with the cattle-people up-
country in the clean areas, but then I had Nairobi so close
that I could send in milk there by car in the morning. We
once ovraed a herd of Grade cows, and then we built a fine
cattle-dip on the plain. But we had to sell out, and the cat-
tle-dip, overgrown with grass, afterwards stood like a sunk
and overturned ruin of a castle in the air. Later on, when in
the evening, at milking-time, I walked down to Mauge’s or
Kaninu’s boma, and smelled the sweet scent of the cows, I
felt again a pang of longing for cow-stables and a dairy of
my own. When I rode on the plain, in my mind I saw it
dotted, as with flowers, with brindled cows.

farewell to the farm

But these plans grew very distant in the course of the
years, and in the end they could hardly be distinguished. I
did not mind either, if I could only make the coffee pay,
and keep the farm going.

It is a heavy burden to carry a farm on you. My Natives,
and my white people even, left me to dread and worry on
their behalf, and it sometimes seemed to me that the farm-
oxen and the coffee-trees themselves, were doing the same. It
appeared to be agreed upon, then, by the speaking creatures
and the dumb, that it w^as my fault that the rains were late
and the nights so cold. And in the evening it did not seem
right that I should sit down quietly to read; I was driven
out of my house by the fear of losing it. Farah knew of all
my sorrows, and he did not approve of my walks at night.
He talked about the leopards that had been seen close to the
house when the sun was down; and he used to stand on the
Verandah, a white-robed figure just visible in the dark, un-
til I came in again. But I was too sad to get any idea of
leopards into my mind, I knew that I did no good whatever
by going round on the roads of the farm in the night, and
still I went, like a ghost that is just said to walk, without any
definition as to why or where to.

Two years before I left Africa I was in Europe on a visit.
I travelled back in the coffee-picking season, so that I could
not get news of the harvest before I came to Mombasa. All
the time on the boat I was weighing the problem in my
mind: when I was well and life was looking friendly, I reck-
oned that we would have got seventy- five tons, but when I
was unwell or nervous I thought: We are bound to get
sixty tons in any case.

Farah came to meet me in Mombasa, and I dared not ask
him about the coffee-crop straight away; for some time we
talked of other news of the farm. But in the evening as I

3^3



OUT OF AFRICA

was going to bed, I could not put it off any longer and I
asked him how many tons of coifee they had picked on the
farm in all. The Somalis are generally pleased to announce a
disaster. But here Farah was not happy, he was extremely
grave himself, standing up by the door, and he half closed
his eyes and laid back his head, swallowing his sorrow,
when he said: “Forty tons, Memsahib.” At that I knew that
we could not carry on. All colour and life faded out of the
world round me, the bleak and stifling Mombasa hotel-
room, with the cemented floor, old iron bedstead and worn
mosquito-net, took on a tremendous significance as the sym-
bol of the world, without any single ornament or article of
embellishment of human life in it. I did not say anything
more to Farah, and he did not speak again, but went away,
the last friendly object in the world.

Still the human mind has great powers of self-renewal,
and in the middle of the night I thought, with Old Knud-
sen, that forty tons was something, but that pessimism,—
pessimism was a fatal vice. And in any case I was going
home now, I would be turning up the drive once more. My
people were there, and my friends would come out to visit
me. In ten hours I was to see, from the railway, to the
South-West, the blue silhouette against the sky of the
Ngong Hills.

The same year the grasshoppers came on the land. It was
said that they came from Abyssinia; after two years of
drought up there, they travelled South and ate up all vege-
tation on their way. Before we ever saw them, there were
strange tales circulating in the country of the devastation
that they had left behind them,— up North, maize and wheat
and fruit-farms were all one vast desert where they had
passed. The settlers sent runners to their neighbours to the
324



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

South to announce the coming of the grasshoppers. Still
you could not do much against them even if you were
warned. On all the farms people had tall piles of firewood
and maize-stalks ready and set fire to them when the grass-
hoppers came, and they sent out all the farm-labourers with
empty tins and cans, and told them to shout and yell and
beat the tins to frighten them from landing. But it was a
short respite only, for however much the farmers would
frighten them the grasshoppers could not keep up in the
air for ever, the only thing that each farmer could hope for
w^as to drive them off to the next farm to the South, and the
more farms they were scared away from, the hungrier and
more desperate were they, when in the end they settled. I
myself had the great plains of the Masai Reserve to the
South, so that I might hope to keep the grasshoppers on the
wing and send them over the river to the Masai.

I had had three or four runners announcing the arrival of
the grasshoppers, from neighbourly settlers of the district,
already, but nothing more had happened, and I began to be-
lieve that it was all a false alarm. One afternoon I rode over
to our dhuka, a farm-shop of all goods, kept for the farm-
labourers and the squatters by Farah’s small brother Ab-
dullai. It was on the highroad, and an Indian in a mule-trap
outside the dhuka rose in his trap and beckoned to me as I
passed, since he could not drive up to me on the plain.

“The grasshoppers are coming, Madam, please, on to
your land,” said he when I rode up to him.

“I have been told that many times,” I said, “but I have
seen nothing of them. Perhaps it is not so bad as people
teU.”

“Turn round kindly, Madam,” said the Indian.

I turned round and saw, along the Northern horizon, a
shadow on the sky, like a long stretch of smoke, a town

325



OUT OF AFRICA

burning, “a million-peopled city vomiting smoke in the
bright air,” I thought, or like a thin cloud rising,

“What is that?” I asked.

“Grasshoppers,” said the Indian.

I saw a few grasshoppers, perhaps twenty in all, on the
path across the plain as I rode back. I passed my manager’s
house and instructed him to have everything ready for re-
ceiving the grasshoppers. As together we looked North the
black smoke on the sky had grown up a little higher. From
time to time while we were watching it, a grasshopper
swished past us in the air, or dropped on the ground and
crawled on.

The next morning as I opened my door and looked out,
the whole landscape outside was the colour of pale dull
terra cotta. The trees, the lawn, the drive, all that I could
see, was covered with the dye, as if in the night a thick
layer of terra cotta coloured snow had fallen on the land.
The grasshoppers were sitting there. While I stood and
looked at it, all the scenery began to quiver and break, the
grasshoppers moved and lifted, after a few minutes the at-
mosphere fluttered with wings, they were going off.

That time they did not do much damage to the farm,
Jiey had been staying with us over the night only. We had
seen what they were like, about an inch and a half long,
brownish grey and pink, sticky to touch. They had broken
a couple of big trees in my drive simply by sitting on
them, and when you looked at the trees and remembered
that each of the grasshoppers could only weigh a tenth of
an ounce, you began to conceive the number of them.

The grasshoppers came again; for two or three months
we had continued attacks of them on the farm. We soon
gave up trying to frighten them off, it was a hopeless and
tragi-comical undertaking. At times a small swarm would
326



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

come along, a free-corps which had detached itself from
the main force, and would just pass in a rush. But at other
times the grasshoppers came in big flights, which took days
to pass over the farm, twelve hours’ incessant hurling ad-
vance in the air. When the flight was at its highest it was
like a blizzard at home, whistling and shrieking like a strong
wind, little hard furious wings to all sides of you and over
your head, shining like thin blades of steel in the sun, but
themselves darkening the sun. The grasshoppers keep in a
belt, from the ground up to the top of the trees, beyond
that the air is clear. They whir against your face, they get
into your collar and your sleeves and shoes. The rush round
you makes you giddy and fills you with a particular sicken-
ing rage and despair, the horror of the mass. The individual
amongst it does not count; kill them and it makes no differ-
ence to anybody. After the grasshoppers have passed and
have gone towards the horizon like a long streak of thin-
ning smoke, the feeling of disgust at your own face and
hands, which have been crawled upon by grasshoppers,
stays with you for a long time.

A great flight of birds followed the advance of the grass-
hoppers, circled above them and came down and walked in
the fields when they settled, living high on the horde: storks
and cranes,— pompous profiteers.

At times the grasshoppers settled on the farm. They did
not do much harm to the coffee-plantation, the leaves of the
coffee-trees, similar to laurel-leaves, are too hard for them
to chew. They could only break a tree here and there in
the field.

But the maize-fields were a sad sight when they had beei?
on them and had left, there was nothing there now but a
few laps of dry leaves hanging from the broken stalks. My
garden by the river, that had been irrigated and kept green,

327



OUT OF AFRICA

was now like a dust-heap, —flowers, vegetables and herbs had
all gone. The shambas of the squatters were like stretches
of cleared and burnt land, rolled even by the crawling in-
sects, with a dead grasshopper in the dust here and there as
the sole fruit of the soil. The squatters stood and looked at
them. The old women who had dug and planted the sham-
bas, standing on their heads, shook their fists at the last faint
black disappearing shadow in the sky.

A lot of dead grasshoppers were left behind the army
everywhere. On the high-road, where they had sat, and
where the waggons and carts had passed, and had driven
over them, now, after the swarm had gone, the wheel-tracks
were marked, like rails of a railway, as long as you could
see them, with little bodies of dead grasshoppers.

The grasshoppers had laid their eggs in the soil. Next
year, after the long rains, the little black-brown hoppers ap-
peared,— grasshoppers in the first stage of life, that cannot
fly, but which crawl along and eat up everything upon
their march.

When I had no more money, and could not make things
pay, I had to sell the farm. A big Company in Nairobi
bought it. They thought that the place was too high up fbr
coffee, and they were not going in for farming. But they
meant to take up all the coffee-trees, to divide up the land
and lay out roads, and in time, when Nairobi should be
growing out to the West, they meant to sell the land for
building-plots. That was towards the end of the year.

Even as it was then, I do not think that I should have
found it in me to give up the farm if it had not been for one
thing. The coffee-crop that was still unripe upon the trees
belonged to the old owners of the farm, or to the Bank
which was holding a first mortgage in it. This coffee would
^28



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

not be picked, handled in the factory and sent off, till May
or later. For such a period I was to remain on the farm, in
charge of it, and things were to go on, unaltered to the
view. And during this time, I thought, something w’^ould
happen to change it all back, since the world, after all, was
not a regular or calculable place.

In this way began for me a strange era in my existence on
the farm. The truth, that was underlying everything, was
that it was no longer mine, but such as it was, this truth
could be ignored by the people incapable of realizing it, and
it made no difference to things from day to day. It was
then, from hour to hour, a lesson in the art of living in the
moment, or, it might be said, in eternity, wherein the actual
happenings of the moment make but little difference.

It was a curious thing that I myself did not, during this
time, ever beUeve that I would have to give up the farm or
to leave Africa. I was told that I must do so by the people
round me, all of them reasonable men; I had letters from
home by each mail to prove it, and all the facts of my daily
life pointed to it. All the same nothing was farther from
my thoughts, and I kept on believing that I should come to
lay my bones in Africa. For this firm faith I had no other
foundation, or no other reason, than my complex incom-
petency of imagining anything else.

During these months, I formed in my own mind a pro-
gramme, or system of strategy, against destiny, and against
the people in my surrounding who were her confederates. I
shall give in, I thought, from this time forward, in all minor
matters, to save myself unnecessary trouble. I shall let my
adversaries have their way from day to day in these affairs,
in talk and writing. For in the end I shall still come out tri-
umphant and shall keep my farm and the people on it. Lose

329



OUT OF AFRICA

them, I thought, I cannot: it cannot be imagined, how then
can it happen?

In this way I was the last person to realize that I was go-
ing. When I look back upon my last months in Africa, it
seems to me that the lifeless things were aware of my depar-
ture a long time before I was so myself. The hills, the for-
ests, plains and rivers, the wind, all knew that we were to
part. When I first began to make terms with fate, and the
negotiations about the sale of the farm were taken up, the
attitude of the landscape towards me changed. Till then I
had been part of it, and the drought had been to me like a
fever, and the flowering of the plain like a new frock. Now
the country disengaged itself from me, and stood back a lit-
tle, in order that I should see it clearly and as a whole.

The hills can do the same thing in the week before the
rains. On an evening as you look at them, they suddenly
make a great movement and uncover, they become as mani-
fest, as distinct and vivid in form and colour, as if they
meant to yield themselves to you, with all that they con-
tain, as if you could walk from where you sit, on to the
green slope. You think: if a bushbuck now walked out in
the open, I might see its eyes as it turned its head, its ears
moving; if a little bird settled on a twig of a bush, I should
hear it sing. In the hills, in March, this gesture of abandon
means that the rains are near, but here, to me, it meant
parting.

I have before seen other countries, in the same manner,
give themselves to you when you are about to leave them,
but I had forgotten what it meant. I only thought that I
had never seen the country so lovely, as if the contempla-
tion of it would in itself be enough to make you happy all
your life. Light and shade shared the landscape between
%em; rainbows stood in the sky.

330



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

When I was with other white people, lawyers and busi-
ness-men of Nairobi, or with my friends who gave me ad-
vice about my journey, my isolation from them felt very
strange, and sometimes like a physical thing, -a kind of suf-
focation, I looked upon myself as the one reasonable person
amongst them all; but once or twice it happened to me to
reflect that if I had been mad, amongst sane people, I should
have felt just the same.

The Natives of the farm, in the stark realism of their
souls, were conscious of the situation and of my state of
mind, as fully as if I had been lecturing to them upon it, or
had written it down for them in a book. All the same, they
looked to me for help and support, and did not, in a single
case, attempt to arrange their future for themselves. They
tried their very best to make me stay on, and for this pur-
pose invented many schemes which they confided to me.
At the time when the sale of the farm was through, they
came and sat round my house from the early morning till
night, not so much in order to talk with me as just to follow
all my movements. There is a paradoxical moment in the
relation between the leader and the followers: that they
should see every weakness and failing in him so clearly, and
be capable of judging him with such unbiased accuracy, and
yet should still inevitably turn to him, as if in life there
were, physically, no way round him, A flock of sheep may
be feeling the same towards the herd-boy, they will have
infinitely better knowledge of the country and the weather
than he, and still will be walking after him, if needs be,
straight into the abyss. The Kikuyu took the situation bet-
ter than I did, on account of their superior inside knowl-
edge of God and the Devil, but they sat round my house
and waited for my orders; very likely all the time between

331



OUT OF AFRICA

themselves expatiating freely upon my ignorance and my
unique incapacity.

You would have thought that their constant presence by
my house, when I knew that I could not help them, and
when their fate weighed heavily on my mind, would have
been hard to bear. But it was not so. We felt, I believe, up
to the very last, a strange comfort and relief in each other’s
company. The understanding between us lay deeper than
all reason. I thought in these months much of Napoleon on
the retreat from Moscow. It is generally thought that he
went through agonies in seeing his grand army suffering
and dying round him, but it is also possible that he would
have dropped down dead on the spot if he had not had
them. In the night, I counted the hours till the time when
the Kikuyus should turn up again by the house.


332







In that same year the Chief Kinanjui died. One of his
sons came to my house late in the evening and asked me
to go back with him to his father’s village, for he was
dying: Na-taka kuja—ht wants to die,— the Natives have it.

Kinanjui was now an old man. A great thing had lately
happened in his life: the quarantine regulations of the Masai
Reserve had been suspended. The old Kikuyu Chief, as soon
as he heard of it, set forth in person, with a few retainers,
deep down South in the Reserve, to wind up his multifari-
ous accounts with the Masai, and bring back with him the
cows that belonged to him, together wdth the calves that
they had produced in their exile. While he w^as down there
he had fallen ill; as far as I could understand he had been
butted in the thigh by a cow, Avhich seemed a becoming
cause of death' to a Kikuyu chief, and the wound had gone
gangrenous. Kinanjui had been staying too long with the
Masai, or had been too ill to undertake the long journey,
when at last he turned his face homewards. Probably he
had so set his heart on getting all his stock with him, that he
had not had it in him to leave until they were all collected,
and it is also possible that he had let himself be nursed by
one of Ms married daughters there, until a slight misgiving

333



OUT OF AFRICA

had risen in him as to her good will to bring him through
his illness. In the end he started, and it seemed that his at-
tendants had done their best for him and had taken great
trouble to get him home, carrying the deadly sick old man
for long distances on a stretcher. Now he lay dying in his
hut, and had sent for me.

Kinanjui’s son had come to my house after dinner, and it
was dark when Farah and I and he drove over to his vil-
lage, but the moon was up and in her first quarter. On the
way Farah opened up the subject of who was to succeed
Kinanjui as chief of the Kikuyu. The old Chief had many
sons, it appeared that there were various influences at work
in the Kikuyu world. Two of his sons, Farah told me, were
Christians, but one was a Roman Catholic, and the other a
convert to the Church of Scotland, and each of the two
Missions was sure to take pains to get their pretender pro-
claimed. The Kikuyus themselves, it seemed, wanted a
third, younger, heathen son.

The road for the last mile was nothing more than a cattle-
track over the sward. The grass was grey with dew. Just
before we got to the village we had to cross a river-bed
with a little winding silvery stream in the middle; here we
drove through a white mist. Kinanjui’s big manyatta, when
we got up to it, was all quiet under the moon, a wide com-
pound of huts, small peaked store-huts, and cattle-bomas.
As we were turning into it, in the light of our lamps I
caught sight, under a thatched roof, of the car which Kinan-
jui had bought from the American Consul at the time when
he came over to the farm to give judgment in the case of
Wanyangerri. She looked completely forlorn, all rusty and
dilapidated, and surely now Kinanjui would be giving her
no thought, but would have turned back to the ways of his
fathers, and demand to see cows and women round him.
334



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

The village that looked so dark was not asleep, the peo>.
pie were up and came and surrounded us when they heard
the car. But it was changed from what it used to be. Kinan-
jui’s manyatta was always a lively and noisy place, like a
well spouting from the ground and running over on all
sides; plans and projects were crossing one another in all di-
rections, and all under the eye of the pompous, benevolent,
central figure of Kinanjui. Now the wing of death lay over
the manyatta, and, like a strong magnet, it had altered the
patterns below, forming new constellations and groups. The
welfare of each member of the family and tribe was at stake,
and such scenes and intrigues as are always played round a
royal death-bed were, you felt, alive here, in the strong
smell of cows, and in the dim moonlight. As we got out of
the car, a boy with a lamp came along and took us up to
Kinanjui’s hut, and a crowd of people went with us and
stood outside it.

I had never before been inside Kinanjui’s house. This
royal mansion was a good deal bigger than the ordinary
Kikuyu hut, but when I entered it I found it to be no more
luxuriously furnished. There was a bedstead made out of
sticks and reins in it, and a few wooden stools to sit on.
Two or three fires burned on the stamped clay floor, the
heat in the hut was suffocating, and the smoke was so dense
that at first I could not see who was in there, although they
had a hurricane lamp standing on the floor. When I had
got a little more used to the atmosphere I saw that there
were three old bald men in the room with me, uncles or
councillors of Kinanjui, a very old woman who hung on a
stick and remained close to the bed, a young pretty girl,
and a boy of thirteen,— and what new constellation, worked
by the magnet, was this, in the Chief’s death-chamber?

Kinanjui lay flat on his bed. He was dying, he was al^



OUT OF AFRICA

ready half-way into death and dissolution, and the stench
about him was so stifling that at first I dared not open my
mouth to speak for fear that I should be sick. The old man
w^as all naked, he was lying upon a tartan rug that I had
once given him, but probably he could not stand any weight
at all on his poisoned leg. The leg was terrible to look at, so
swollen that you could not distinguish the place of the
knee, and in the lamplight I could see that it was streaked
all the way from the hip to the foot with black and yellow
streaks. Underneath the leg, the rug was dark and wet as if
water was all the time running from it.

Kinanjui’s son, who had come to the farm to fetch me,
brought in an old European chair, with one leg shorter
than the others, and placed it very close to the bed, for me
to sit on.

Kinanjui’s head and trunk were so emaciated that all the
structure of his big skeleton stood forth, he looked like a
huge dark wooden figure roughly cut with a knife. His
teeth and his tongue showed between his lips. His eyes
were half dimmed, milky in his dark face. But he could still
see, and when I came up to the bed he turned his eyes on
me and kept them on my face all the time that I was in the
hut. Very very slowly he dragged his right hand across his
body to touch my hand. He was in terrible pain, but he was
still himself and was still carrying great weight, naked upon
his bed. From the look of him, I thought that he had come
back from his journey triumphant, and had got all his cat-
tle back with him, in spite of his Masai sons-in-law. I re-
membered, while I sat and looked at him, that he had had
one weakness: he had been afraid of thunder, and when a
thunderstorm broke, while he was in my house, he adopted
a rodent manner and looked round for a burrow. But here
now he feared no more the lightning flash, nor the all-
^^6



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

dreaded thunder-stone: he had plainly, I thought, done his
worldly task, gone home, and taken his wages in every
sense. If he were clear enough in his mind to look back at
his life, he would find very few instances in which he had
not got the better of it. A great vitality and power of en-
joyment, a manifold activity were at their end here, where
Kinanjui lay still. “Quiet consummation have, Kinanjui,”—
I thought.

The old men in the hut stood by, as if they had lost the
faculty of speech. It was the boy, who had been in there
when I came, and wTom I took to be a late-born son of
Kinanjui’s, who now came up close to his father’s bed and
talked to me, in accordance, I thought, with what had been
agreed upon before I arrived.

The doctor from the Mission, he explained, had heard of
Kinanjui’s illness and had been to see him. He had told the
Kikuyus that he would come back again to fetch the dying
chief into the Mission hospital, and they were expecting the
lorry from the Mission which was to bring him there, that
same night. But Kinanjui did not want to go into hospital.
That was why he had sent for me. He wanted me to take
him with me to my own house, and he meant me to take
him now, before the people from the Mission should return.
While the boy spoke, Kinanjui looked at me.

I sat and listened with a heavy heart.

If Kinanjui had lain dying at any time in the past, a year
ago or even three months ago, I would have taken him with
me to my house on his asking for it. But to-day it was a dif-
ferent thing. Things had gone badly with me lately and had
made me fear that they would go on worse. I had been
spending days in the offices of Nairobi, listening to busi-
ness-men and lawyers, and at meetings with the creditors of

337



OUT OF AFRICA

the farm. The house, to which Kinanjui asked me to take
him, was no longer my own house.

Kinanjui, I thought, as I sat and looked at him, was going
to die, he could not be saved. He would die in my car on
the way home, or at the arrival to the house. The Mission
people would come and blame me for his death; everybody
who heard of it would agree with them.

All this, from my seat on the broken chair in the hut,
looked to me as a weight too heavy to take on. I had not
got it in me any longer to stand up against the authorities of
the world. I did not have it in me now to brave them all,
not all of them.

I tried two or three times to make up my mind to take
Eananjui and my courage failed me every time. I thought
then that I should have to leave him.

Farah had stood by the door, and had followed the boy’s
speech. When he saw me sitting on silent, he came up to
me and in a low eager voice began an explanation of how
we were best to lift Kinanjui into the car. I got up and
went with him to the background of the hut, somewhat
away from the eyes and the stench of the old man on the
bed. I told Farah then that I was not going to take Kinanjui
back with me. Farah was completely unprepared for this
turn of things, his eyes and whole face darkened with sur-
prise.

I should have liked to have stayed a little with Eananjui,
but I did not want to see the people from the Mission ar-
rive and take him away.

I went up to Kinanjui’s bed and told him that I could not
take him with me back to my house. There was no need to
give reasons, so we left it at that. The old men in the hut,
when they understood my declination, gathered round me
and stirred uneasily, the boy stepped back a little and stood

338



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

immovable, he had no more to do. Kinanjui himself did not
stir or change in any way, he kept his eyes on me as he had
done all the time. He looked as if something like this had
happened to him before, which very likely it had.

“Kwaheri, Kinanjui,” I said,— Good-bye,

His burning fingers moved a little against my palm. Al-
ready before I had got to the door of the hut, when I
turned and looked back, the dimness and smoke of the
room had swallowed up the big outstretched figure of my
Kikuyu Chief. As I came out again from the hut it was very
cold. The moon was now low down at the horizon, it must
have been past midnight. Just then in the manyatta one of
Kinanjui’s cocks crew twice.

Kinanjui died that same night, in the Mission hospital.
Two of his sons came over to my house next afternoon to
tell me. They did at the same time ask me to the funeral,
which was to take place on the following day, near his vik-
lage, at Dagoretti.

The Kikuyus, when left to themselves, do not bury their
dead, but leave them above ground for the Hyenas and vul-
ture to deal with. The custom had always appealed to me, I
thought that it would be a pleasant thing to be laid out to
the sun and the stars, and to be so promptly, neatly and
openly picked and cleansed; to be made one with Nature
and become a’ common component of a landscape. At the
time when we had the Spanish flu on the farm, I heard the
Hyenas round the shambas all night, and often, after those
days, I would find a brown smooth skull in the long grass
of the forest, like a nut dropped down under a tree, or on
the plain. But the practice does not go with the conditions
of civilized life. The government had taken much trouble
to make the Kikuyu change their ways, and to teach them

339



our OF AFRICA

to lay their dead in the ground, but they still did not like
the idea at all.

Kinanjui, they now told me, was to be buried, and I
thought that the Kikuyu would have agreed to make an ex-
ception from their habit because the dead had been a Chief.
Perhaps they would like to make a great Native show and
gathering, of the occasion. I drove over to Dagoretti, on
the following afternoon, expecting to find all the old minor
Chiefs of the country, and to see a big Kikuyu festivity.

But Kinanjui’s funeral was altogether a European and
clerical affair. There were a few Government Representa-
tives present, the District Commissioner and two Officials
from Nairobi. But the day and the place belonged to the
Clergy; and the plain, in the afternoon sun, was black with
them. Both the French Mission and the Missions of the
Church of England and Scotland, were richly represented.
If they wished to impress the Kikuyu with the feeling that
here they had laid their hand on the dead Chief, and that he
now belonged to them, they succeeded. They were so ob-
viously in power that one felt it to be out of the question
for Kinanjui to get away from them. This is an old trick of
the Church’s. Here I saw for the first time, in any number
to speak of, the Mission-boys, the converted Natives, half
sacerdotally attired, whatever office they might be filling,
fat young Kikuyus with spectacles and folded hands, who
looked like ungenial Eunuchs. Probably Kinanjui’s two
Christian sons were there, laying down their religious dis-
agreements for the day, but I did not know them. Some of
the old Chiefs were attending the funeral, Keoy was there,
and I talked with him for some time of Kinanjui. But they
kept themselves much in the background of the show.

Kinanjui’s grave had been dug under a couple of tall
Eucalyptus trees on the plain, and a rope was extended
^40



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


round it. I had come early and therefore stood close to the
grave, by the rope, from where I could watch the assem-
blage grow and settle, like flies, round it.

They brought Kinanjui from the Mission on a lorry, and
lifted him down near the grave. I do not think that I have
ever in my life been more taken aback and appalled than I
was then, at the sight of him. He had been a big man, and I
remembered him as I had seen him when he came walking
over to the farm amongst his senators, even as he had
looked lying on his bed, two nights ago. But the cofiin in
which they now brought him was a nearly square box,
surely no more than five feet long. I did not take it to be a
coffin when I first set eyes on it; it must be, I thought,
some box of appliances for the funeral. But it was Kinan-
jui’s coffin. I have never known why it was chosen, per-
haps it w’as a thing that they had had at the Scotch Mission.
But how had they got Kinanjui down there and how was he
now lying in it? They placed the coffin on the ground,
close to where I stood.

The coffin had a large silver plate on it with an inscrip-
tion, which told, I was afterwards informed, that it had
been given by the Mission to the Chief Kinanjui, and with a
scriptural text on it.

There was a long funeral service. One after another, the
Missionaries stood forth and spoke, and I suppose that they
got in much

any of it, I was holding on to the rope round Kinanjui’s
grave. Some of the Cluistian Natives followed them up,
and brayed out over the green plain.

In the end Kinanjui was lowered into the ground of his
own country, and covered with it.

I had taken my house-boys with me to Dagoretti so that
they should see the funeral, and they were staying to talk

341


profession and admonition. But I did not hear

with their friends and relations there, and coming back on
foot, so that Farah and I drove home by ourselves. Farah
was as silent as the grave we had left. It had been hard to
Farah to swallow the fact that I would not take Kinanjui
back to my house with me, for two days he had been like
a lost soul, and in the clutch of great doubts and depres-
sions.

Now as we drove up before the door he said: “Never
mind, Memsahib.”

Denys Finch-Hatton had come in from one of his Safaris^
and he had stayed for a little while on the farm, but, when
I began to break up my house and to pack, and he could
stay there no longer, he went away and lived in Hugh
Martin’s house in Nairobi. From there he drove out to
the farm every day and dined with me, sitting,— towards
the end, when I was selling my furniture,— on one packing-
case and dining from another. We sat there late into the
night.

A few times, Denys and I spoke as if I was really going
to leave the country. He himself looked upon Africa as his
home, and he understood me very well and grieved with me
then, even if he laughed at my distress at parting with my
people.

“Do you feel,” he said, “that you cannot live without
Sirunga?”

“Yes,” I said.

But most of the time when we were together, we talked
and acted as if the future did not exist; it had never been his
way to worry about it, for it was as if he knew that he
could draw upon forces unknown to us if he wanted to. He
fell in naturally with my scheme of leaving things to them-

343



OUT OF AFRICA


selves, and other people to think and say what they liked.
When he was there, it seemed to be a normal thing, and in
accordance with our own taste, that we should sit upon
packing-cases within an empty house. He quoted a poem
to me:


“You must turn your mournful ditty
To a merry measure,

I will never come for pity,

I will come for pleasure.”

During those weeks, we used to go up for short flights
out over the Ngong Hills or down over the Game Reserve.
One morning, Denys came out to the farm to fetch me
quite early, just as the sun was up, and then we saw a lion
on the plain South of the Hills.

He talked of packing up his books, that had been in my
house for many years, but he never got any further with
the job.

“You keep them,” he said, “now I have no place to put
them.”

He could not make up his mind at all where to go when
my house should be closed. Once, upon the persistent ad-
vice of a friend, he went so far as to drive in to Nairobi,
and to take a look at the bungalows to be let there, but he
came back so repelled with what he had seen that he did
not even like to talk about it, and at dinner, when he began
to give me a description of the houses and the furniture, he
stopped himself and sat silent over it, with a dislike and sad-
ness in his face that was unusual to him. He had been in
contact with a kind of existence the idea of which was un-
bearable to him.

It was, however, a completely objective and impersonal

344



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

disapprobation, he had forgotten that he himself had meant
to be a party to this existence, and when I spoke of it, he in-
terrupted me. “Oh, as to me,” he said, “I shall be perfectly
happy in a tent in the Masai Reserve, or I shall take a house
in the Somali village.”

But on this occasion he, for once, spoke of my future in
Europe. I might be happier there than on the farm, he
thought, and well out of the sort of civilization that we
were going to get in Africa. “You know,” he went on,
“this Continent of Africa has a terrible strong sense of sar-
casm.”

Denys owned a piece of land down at the coast, thirty
miles North of Mombasa on the Creek of Takaunga. Here
were the ruins of an old Arab settlement, with a very mod-
est minaret and a well,— a weathered growth of grey stone
on the salted soil, and in the midst of it a few old Mango
trees. He had built a small house on his land and I had stayed
there. The scenery was of a divine, clean, barren Marine
greatness, with the blue Indian Ocean before you, the deep
creek of Takaunga to the South, and the long steep un-
broken coast-line of pale grey and yellow coral-rock as far
as the eye reached.

When the tide was out, you could walk miles away Sea-
wards from the house, as on a tremendous, somewhat un-
evenly paved Piazza, picking up strange long peaked shells
and starfish. The Swaheli fishermen came wandering along
here, in a loin-cloth and red or blue turbans, like Sindbad
the Sailor come to life, to offer for sale multi-coloured
spiked fish, some of which were very good to eat. The
coast below the house had a row of scooped-out deep caves
and grottoes, where you sat in shade and watched the dis-
tant glittering blue water. When the tide came in, it filled
up the caves to the level of the ground on which the house

345



OUT OF AFRICA

was built, and in the porous coral-rock the Sea sang and
sighed in the strangest way, as if the ground below your
feet were alive; the long waves came running up Takaunga
Creek like a storming army.

It was full moon while I was down at Takaunga, and
the beauty of the radiant, still nights was so perfect that the
heart bent under it. You slept with the doors open to the
silver Sea; the playing warm breeze in a low whisper swept
in a little loose sand, on to the stone floor. One night a row
of Arab dhows came along, close to the coast, running
noiselessly before the monsoon, a file of brown shadow-sails
under the moon.

Denys sometimes talked of making Takaunga his home in
Africa, and of starting his Safaris from there. When I be-
gan to talk of having to leave the farm, he offered me his
house down there, as he had had mine in the highlands. But
white people cannot live for a long time at the coast unless
they are able to have many comforts, and Takaunga was
too low and too hot for me.

In the month of May of the year when I left Africa,
Denys went down to Takaunga for a week. He was plan-
ning to build a larger house and to plant Mango trees on his
land. He went away in his aeroplane and was intending to
make his way home round by Voi, to see if there were any
Elephants there for his Safaris. The Natives had been talk-
ing much of a herd of Elephants which had come on to the
land round Voi from the West, and in particular of one big
bull, twice the size of any other Elephant, that was wander-
bg in the bush there, all by himself.

Denys, who held himself to be an exceptionally rational
person, was subject to a special kind of moods and forebod-
ings, and under their influence at times he became silent for
days or for a week, though he ,did not know of it himself
346



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


and was surprised when I asked him what was the matter
with him. The last days before he started on this journey to
the coast, he was in this manner absent-minded, as if sunk
in contemplation, but when I spoke of it he laughed at me.

I asked him to let me come with him, for I thought what
a lovely thing it would be to see the Sea. First he said yes,
and then he changed his mind and said no. He could not
take me; the journey round Voi, he told me, was going to
be very rough, he might have to land, and to sleep, in the
bush, so that it would be necessary for him to take a Native
boy with him. I reminded him that he had said that he had
taken out the aeroplane to fly me over Africa. Yes, he said,
so he had; and if there were Elephants at Voi, he would fly
me down there to have a look at them, when he knew the
landing-places and camping-grounds. This is the only time
that I have asked Denys to take me with him on his aero-
plane that he would not do it.

He went off on Friday the eighth: “Look out for me on
Thursday,” he said when he went, “I shall be back in time
to have luncheon with you.”

When he had started in his car for the aerodrome in
Nairobi, and had turned down the drive, he came back to
look for a volume of poems that he had given to me, and
that he now wanted with him on his journey. He stood
with one foot on the running-board of the car, and a finger
in the book, reading out to me a poem that we had been dis-
cussing.

“Here are your grey geese,” he said:

“I saw grey geese flying over the flatlands
Wild geese vibrant in the high air—

Unswerving from horizon to horizon
With their soul stiffened out in their throats—


347



OUT OF AFRICA

And the grey whiteness of them ribboning the
enormous skies

And the spokes of the sun over the crumpled hills.”

Then he drove away for good, waving his arm to me.

While Denys was down in Mombasa, in landing he broke
a propeller. He wired back to Nairobi to get the spare parts
that he wanted, and the East Africa Airway Company sent
a boy to Mombasa with them. When the aeroplane was
fixed, and Denys was again going up in it, he told the Air-
way’s boy to come up with him. But the boy would not
come. This boy was used to flying, and had been up with
many people, and with Denys himself, before now, and
Denys was a fine pilot and had a great name with the Na-
tives in this capacity as in all others. But this time the boy
would not go up with him.

A long time after, when he met Farah in Nairobi and
they were talking things over, he said to Farah: “Not for a
hundred rupees would I, then, have gone up with Bwana
Bedar.” The shadow of destiny, which Denys hiniself had
felt the last days at Ngong, was seen more strongly now, by
the Native.

So Denys took Kamau with him to Voi, his own boy.
Poor Kamau was terrified of flying. He had told me, at the
farm, that when he got up and away from the ground, he
fixed his eyes at his feet , and kept them there till he got
down to the earth again, so frightened did he feel if ever he
cast a glance over the side of the aeroplane, and saw the
landscape from its great height.

I looked out for Denys on Thursday, and reckoned that
he would fly from Voi at sunrise and be two hours on the
way to Ngong. But when he did not come, and I found
that I had got things to do in Nairobi, I drove in to town.



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

Whenever I was ill in Africa, or much worried, I suffered
from a special kind of compulsive idea. It seemed to me
then that all my surroundings were in danger or distress,
and that in the midst of this disaster I myself was somehow
on the wrong side, and therefore was regarded with distrust
and fear by everybody.

This nightmare was in reality a reminiscence of the time
of the war. For then for a couple of years, people in the
Colony had believed me to be a pro-German at heart, and
had^ looked at me with mistrust. Their suspiciousness rose
from the fact that I had, in the innocence of my heart, a
short time before the outbreak of war, been up at Naivasha
buying horses for General von Lettow down in German
East Africa. He had asked me, when we travelled out to
Africa together six months before, to buy him ten Abys-
sinian breeding-mares, but during my first time in the coun-
try I had had other things to think of, and had forgotten
about it, so that it was only later, when he kept on writing
of the mares to me, that in the end I went up to Naivasha
to buy them for him. The war broke out so shortly after,
that the mares never got out of the country. Still I could
not get away from the fact that I had, at the outbreak of
the war, been buying up horses for the German army. The
suspicion against me did not, however, last till the end of
the war, it passed away when my brother, who had been
volunteering with the English, got the V.C. in the Amiens
push, north of Roye. That event was even announced in
the “East African Standard” under the headline of: An
East-African F.C.

At the time, I had taken my isolation lightly, for I was
not in the least pro-German, and I thought that I should be
able to clear things up if it became necessary. But it must
have gone deeper with me than I knew of, and for many

349



OUT OF AFRICA

years after, when I was very tired or when I had a high
temperature, the feeling of it would come back. During my
last months in Africa, when everything was going wrong
with me, it sometimes suddenly fell upon me like a dark-
ness, and in a way I was frightened of it, as of a sort of de-
rangement.

On this Thursday in Nairobi the nightmare unexpectedly
stole upon me, and grew so strong that I wondered if I
Were beginning to go mad. There was, somehow, a deep
sadness over the town, and over the people I met, and in
the midst of it everybody was turning away from me.
There was nobody who would stop and talk to me, my
friends, when they saw me, got into their cars and drove
off. Even old Mr. Duncan, the Scotch grocer, from whom I
had bought groceries for many years, and with whom I had
danced at a big ball at Government House, when I came in
looked at me with a kind of fright and left his shop. I be-
gan to feel as lonely in Nairobi as on a desert island.

I had left Farah on the farm to receive Denys, so that I
had nobody to talk with. The Kikuyus are no good in such
a case, for their ideas of reality, and their reality itself, are
different from ours. But I was to lunch with Lady McMil-
lan at Chiromo, and I thought that there I should find white
people to talk to, and get back my balance of mind.

I drove up to the lovely old Nairobi house of Chiromo,
at the end of the long bamboo avenue, and found a lunch-
eon-party there. But it was the same thing at Chiromo as in
the streets of Nairobi. Everybody seemed mortally sad, and
dS 1 came in the talk stopped I sat beside my old friend Mr.
Bulpett, and he looked down and said only a few words. I
tried to throw off the shadow that was by now lying heav-
ily upon me, and to talk to him of his mountain-climbings
in Mexico, but he seemed to remember nothing about them.

350



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


I thought: These people are no good to me, I will go
back to the farm. Denys will be there by now. We will
talk and behave sensibly, and I shall be sane again and know
and understand everything.

But when we had finished luncheon, Lady McMillan
asked me to come with her into her small sitting-room, and
there told me that there had been an accident at Voi. Denys
had capsized with his machine, and had been killed in the
fall.

It was then as I had thought: at the sound of Denys’s
name even, truth was revealed, and I knew and understood
everything.

Later on, the District Commissioner at Voi wrote to me
and gave me the particulars of the accident. Denys had
been staying with him over the night, and had left from
the aerodrome in the morning, with his boy in the aeroplane
with him, for my farm. After he had left he turned and
came back quickly, flying low, at two hundred feet. Sud-
denly the aeroplane swayed, got into a spin, and came
down like a bird swooping. As it hit the ground it caught
fire, the people who ran to it were stopped by the heat.
When they got branches and earth, and had thrown them
on the fire, and had got it out, they found that the aero-
plane had been all smashed up, and the two people in it had
been killed in the fall.

For many years after this day the Colony felt Denys’s
death as a loss which could not be recovered. Something
fine then came out in the average colonist’s attitude towards
him, a reverence for values outside their understanding.
When they spoke of him it was most often as an athlete;
they would discuss his exploits as a cricketer and a golfer,
and of these things I had never heard myself, so that it was
only now that I learned of his great fame in all games. Then



OUT OF AFRICA

when the people had been paying tribute to him as a sports-
man, they would add that, of course, he had been very bril-
liant. What they really remembered in him was his absolute
lack of self-consciousness, or self-interest, an unconditional
truthfulness which outside of him I have only met in idiots.
In a colony, these qualities are not generally held up for
imitation, but after a man’s death they may be, perhaps,
more truly admired than in other places.

The Natives had known Denys better than the white
people; to them his death was a bereavement.

When, in Nairobi, I was told of Denys’s death I tried to
get down to Voi. The Airway Company was sending down
Tom Black to report on the accident, and I drove to the
Aerodrome to ask him to take me with him, but as I got
into the Aerodrome, his aeroplane lifted and sailed off, to-
wards Voi.

It might still be possible to get through by car, but the
long rains were on, and I had to find out what the roads
were like. While I sat and waited for the report on the
roads, I remembered how Denys had told me that he wished
to be buried in the Ngong Hills. It was a strange thing that
I had not recollected it before, but it had been so far from
my thoughts that they should mean to bury him at all. Now ^
it was as if a picture had been shown to me.

There was a place in the Hills, on the first ridge in the
Game Reserve, that I myself at the time when I thought
that I was to live and die in Africa, had pointed out to
Denys as my future burial-place. In the evening, while we
sat and looked at the hills, from my house, he remarked
that then he would like to be buried there himself as well.
Since then, sometimes when we drove out in the hills, Denys
had said: “Let us drive as far as our graves.” Once when we .
were camped in the hills to look for Buffalo, we had in the



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

afternoon walked over to the slope to have a closer look at
it. There was an infinitely great view from there; in the
light of the sunset we saw both Mount Kenya and Kiliman-
jaro. Denys had been eating an orange, lying in the grass,
and had said that he would like to stay there. My own
burial-place was a little higher up. From both places we
could see my house in the forest far away to the East. We
were going back there the next day, for ever, I thought, in
spite of the widespread theory that All must die.

Gustav Mohr had come from his farm to my house, when
he heard of Denys’s death, and when he did not find me
there he looked me up in Nairobi. A little while after,
Hugh Martin came and sat down with us. I told them of
Denys’s wish, and of the burial-place in the hills, and they
wired to the people at Voi. Before I went back to the farm
they informed me that they would bring Denys’s body up
by train next morning, so that the funeral could take place
in the hills at noon. I must have his grave ready there by
then.

Gustav Mohr went with me to the farm, to sleep there,
and help me in the morning. We would have to be out in
the hills just before sunrise to decide on the place, and to
have the grave dug in time.

It rained all night, and there was a fine drizzling rain in
the morning when we went away. The waggon-tracks on
the road were full of water. Driving up in the hills was like
driving into clouds. We could not see the plains below to
our left, nor the slopes or peaks of the hills to our right;
the boys who came with us in a lorry disappeared behind
us at a distance of ten yards, and the mist grew thicker as
the road mounted. By the sign-board on the road, we found
where we got into the Game Reserve, so we drove on a few
hundred yards and then got out of the car. We left the

353



OUT OF AFRICA

would not notice the small group of people by the grave in
the bush. The Somalis of Nairobi came out, they left their
mule-traps on the highroad, and walked slowly up, three or
four together, mourning in the Somali way, as if wrapping
up their heads and withdrawing from life. Some of Denys’s
friends from up-country, who had had news of his death,
came driving from Naivasha, Gil-Gil, and Elmenteita, their
cars all covered with mud from the long fast drive. Now’ the
day grew clearer, and the four tall peaks of the hills show^ed
above us against the sky.

Here in the early afternoon they brought out Denys from
Nairobi, following his old Safari-track to Tanganyika, and
driving slowly on the wet road. When they came to the last
steep slope, they lifted out, and carried the narrow coffin,
that was covered with the flag. As it was placed in the
grave, the country changed and became the setting for it,
as still as itself, the hills stood up gravely, they knew and
understood what we were doing in them; after a little while
they themselves took charge of the ceremony, it was an
action between them and him, and the people present be-
came a party of very small lookers-on in the landscape.

Denys had watched and followed all the ways of the Af-
rican Highlands, and better than any other white man, he
had known their soil and seasons, the vegetation and the
wild animals, the winds and smells. He had observed the
changes of weather in them, their people, clouds, the stars
at night. Here in the hills, I had seen him only a short time
ago, standing bare-headed in the afternoon sun, gazing out
over the land, and lifting his field-glasses to find out every-
thing about it. He had taken in the country, and in his eyes
and his mind it had been changed, marked by his own indi-
viduality, and made part of him. Now Africa received him,
and would change him, and make him one with herself.



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

The Bishop of Nairobi, I was told, had not wanted tc
come out, because there had not been time to have the
burial-ground consecrated, but there was another clergy-
man present, who read out the funeral service, which I had
lever heard before, and in the great space his voice sounded
;mall and clear, like the voice of a bird in the hills. I thought
:hat Denys would like the whole thing best when it w^as
over. The priest read out a Psalm: “I will lift up mine eyes
unto the hills.”

Gustav Mohr and I sat on for a little while, after the
other white people had left. The Mohammedans waited till
we had gone, and then went and prayed by the grave.

In the days after Denys’s death, his Safari servants came
in, and gathered on the farm. They did not say why they
came, and did not ask for anything, but sat down with their
backs to the wall of the house, and the backs of their hands,
resting upon the pavement, most of the time in silence, con-
trary to the habits of Natives. Malimu and Sar Sita came
there, Denys’s bold, shrewd, fearless gunbearers and track-
ers, who had been with him on all his Safaris. They had
been out with the Prince of Wales, and many years after,
the Prince remembered their names, and said that the two
of them together had been hard to beat. Here the great
trackers had lost the track, and sat immovable. Kanuthia, his
motor-driver, came in, who had driven over many thousand
miles of rough" country, a slim young Kikuyu with the
watchful eyes of a monkey, now he sat by the house like a
sad and chilly monkey in a cage.

Bilea Isa, Denys’s Somali servant, came down from Nai-
vasha to the farm. Bilea had been to England twice with
Denys, had been to school there, and spoke English like a
gentleman. Some years ago, Denys and I had attended Bilea’s
wedding in Nairobi; it was a magnificent feast that lasted

357



OUT OF AFRICA

for seven days. On that occasion, the great traveller and
scholar had gone back to the ways of his ancestors, he had
been dressed in a golden robe, and had bowed down to the
ground when he welcomed us, and he danced the sword-
dance, all wild with the desperado spirit of the desert. Bilea
came down to see his master’s grave, and sit on it; he came
back from it and spoke very little, after a little while, he
sat with the others with his back to the wall, and the backs
of his hands resting on the pavement.

Farah went out and stood and talked with the mourners.
He himself was very grave. “It would not have been so
bad,” he said to me, “that you were going away from the
country, if only Bedar had still been here.”

Denys’s boys stayed for about a week, then one after the
other they left again.

I often drove out to Denys’s grave. In a bee-line, it was
not more than five miles from my house, but round by the
road it was fifteen. The grave was a thousand feet higher
up than my house, the air was different here, as clear as a
glass of water; light sweet winds lifted your hair when you
took off your hat; over the peaks of the hills, the clouds
came wandering from the East, drew their live shadow over
the wide undulating land, and were dissolved and disappeared
over the Rift Valley.

I bought at the dhuka a yard of the white cloth which the
Natives call Americani, and Farah and I raised three tall
poles in the ground behind the grave, and nailed the cloth
on to them, then from my house I could distinguish the
exact spot of the grave, like a litde white point in the green
hiU.

The long rains had been heavy, and I was afraid that the
grass would grow up and cover the grave so that its place
would be lost. Therefore one day we took up all the whiter

358



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

washed stones along my drive, the same that Karomenya
had had trouble in pulling up and carrying to the front
door; we loaded them into my box-body car and drove
them up into the hills. We cut down the grass round the
grave, and set the stones in a square to mark it; now the
place could always be found.

As I went so often to the grave, and took the children of
my household with me, it became a familiar place to them;
they could show the way out there to the people who came
to see it. They built a small bower in the bush of the hill
near it. In the course of the summer, Ali bin Salim, whose
friend Denys had been, came from Mombasa to go out and
lie on the grave and weep, in the Arab way.

One day I found Hugh Martin by the grave, and we sat
in the grass and talked for a long time. Hugh Martin had
taken Denys’s death much to heart. If any human being at
all had held a place in his queer seclusive existence, it would
have been Denys. An ideal is a strange thing, you would
never have given Hugh credit for harbouring the idea of
one, neither would you have thought that the loss of it
would have affected him, like, somehow, the loss of a vital
organ. But since Denys’s death he had aged and changed
much, his face was blotched and drawn. All the same he
preserved his placid, smiling likeness to a Chinese Idol, as if
he knew of something exceedingly satisfactory, that was
hidden to the general. He told me now that he had, in the
night, suddenly struck upon the right epitaph for Denys. I
think that he had got it from an ancient Greek author, he
quoted it to me in Greek, then translated it in order that I
should understand it. It went: “Though in death fire be
mixed with my dust yet care I not. For with me now all
is well.”

Later on, Denys’s brother, Lord Winchilsea, had an obelisk

359



OUT OF AFRICA

set on his grave, with an inscription out of ‘‘The Ancient
Mariner,” which was a poem that Denys had much admired.

I myself had never heard it until Denys quoted it to me,-
the first time was, I remember, as we were going to Bilea’s
wedding. I have not seen the obelisk; it was put up after I
had left Africa.

In England there is also a monument to Denys. His old
schoolfellows, in memory of him, built a stone bridge over
a small stream berw’'een two fields at Eton. On one of the
balustrades is inscribed his name, and the dates of his stay at
Eton, and on the other the words: “Famous in these fields
and by his many friends much beloved.”

Between the river in the mellow English landscape and
the African mountain ridge, ran the path of his life; it is an
optical illusion that it seemed to wind and swerve,— the sur-
roundings swerved. The bow-string was released on the
bridge at Eton, the arrow described its orbit, and hit the
obelisk in the Ngong Hills.

After I had left Africa, Gustav Mohr wrote to me of a
strange thing that had happened by Denys's grave, the like
of which I have never heard. “The Masai,” he wrote, “have
reported to the District Commissioner at Ngong, that many
times, at sunrise and sunset, they have seen lions on Finch-^
Hatton’s grave in the Hills. A lion and a lioness have come
tliere, and stood, or lain, on the grave for a long time. Some
of the Indians who have passed the place in their lorries on
the way to Kajado have also seen them. After you went
away, the ground round the grave was levelled out, into a
sort of big terrace, I suppose that the level place makes a
good site for the lions, from there they can have a view
over the plain, and the cattle and game on it.”

It was fit and decorous that the Hons should come to*

Denys s grave and make him an African monument. “And
renowned be thy grave.” Lord Nelson himself, I have re-
flected, in Trafalgar Square, has his lions made only out of
stone.

Now I was alone on the farm. It was no longer mine,
but the people who had bought it had offered to let me
stay in the house as long as I liked, and for legal reasons
were leasing it to me for a ShiUing a day.

I was selling my furniture, which gave Farah and me a
vood deal to do. We had to have all the china and table-
glass on view upon the dinner-table; later on, when the
table had been sold, we arranged it in long rows on the
floor. The cuckoo of the clock sang out the hours arro-
gantly over the rows, then it was itself sold, and flew off.
One day I sold my table-glass, and then in the night thought
better of it, so that in the morning I drove to Nairobi and
asked the lady who had bought it to call off the deal. I had
no place to put the glass, but the fingers and lips of many
friends had touched it, they had given me excellent wine to
drink out of it; it was keeping an echo of old table-talk,
and I did not want to part with it. After all, I thought, it
would be an easy thing to break.

I had an old wooden screen with painted figures of China-
men, Sultans and Negroes, with dogs on leads, which had
had its place by the fire. There in the evenings, when the
fire burned clear, the figures would come out, and serve as

362



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


illustrations to the tales that I told Denys. After I had
looked at it for a long time, I folded it up and packed it in a
case, wherein the figures might all have a rest for the time
being.

Lady McMillan was at this time finishing the McMillan
Memorial in Nairobi, that she had built to her husband, Sir
Northrup McMillan. It was a fine building, with a library
and reading-rooms. She now drove out to the farm, sat and
talked sadly of old days, and bought most of my old Danish
furniture, that I had taken out from home with me, for the
library. I was pleased to know that the cheerful, wise and
hospitable chests and cabinets were to remain together, in a
milieu of books and scholars, like a small circle of ladies
who, in times of revolution, find an asylum in a University.

My own books I packed up in cases and sat on them, or
dined on them. Books in a colony play a different part in
your existence from what they do in Europe; there is a
whole side of your life which there they alone take charge
of; and on this account, according to their quality, you feel
more grateful to them, or more indignant with them, than
you will ever do in civilized countries.

The fictitious characters in the books run beside your
horse on the farm, and walk about in the maize-fields. On
their own, like intelligent soldiers, they find at once the
quarters that suit them. On the morning after I had been
reading “Crome Yellow” at night,-and I had never heard of
the author’s name, but had picked up the book in a Nairobi
bookshop, and was as pleased as if I had discovered a new
green island in the sea,— as I was riding through a valley of
the Game Reserve, a little duiker jumped up, and at once
turned himself into a stag for Sir Hercules with his wife
and his pack of thirty black and fawn-coloured pugs. All
Walter Scott’s characters were at home in the country and



OUT OF AFRICA

might be met anywhere; so were Odysseus and his men,
and strangely enough many figures from Racine. Peter
Schlemihl had walked over the hills in seven-league boots,
Clown Agheb the honey-bee lived in my garden by the
river.

Other things were sold out of the house, packed and sent
off, so that the house, in the course of these months, became
das Ding an sich, noble like a skull, a cool and roomy place
to dwell in, with an echo to it, and the grass of the lawn
growing long up to the doorstep. In the end there were no
things in the rooms at all, and to my mind at the time they
seemed, in this state, more fit to live in than they had been
before.

I said to Farah, “This is how we ought to have had it all
the time.”

Farah understood me very well, for all Somali have some-
thing of the ascetic in them. Farah during this time was set
and concentrated upon assisting me in everything; but he
was growing to look more and more like a true Somali, such
as he had looked in Aden, where he had been sent to meet
me, when I first came to Africa. He was much concerned
about my old shoes, and confided to me that he was going
to pray to God every day that they might last until I got
to Paris.

During these months, Farah wore his best clothes every
day. He had a lot of fine clothes: gold-embiroidered Arab
waistcoats that I had given him, and a very elegant scarlet
gold-laced uniform waistcoat that Berkeley Cole had given
him, and silk turbans in beautiful colours. Generally he kept
them all in chests, and wore them only on special occasions.
But now he put on the best he had. He walked one step be-
hind me in the streets of Nairobi, or waited on the dirty
stairs in the Government buildings and the lawyers’ offices,



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

dressed like Solomon in all his glor}^ It took a Somali to do
that.

I had now also got to deal with the fate of my horses and
my dogs. I had all the time meant to shoot them, but many
of my friends wrote to me and asked me to let them have
them. After that, whenever I rode out and had the dogs
with me, it did not seem fair on them to shoot them,— they
had much life in them still. It took me a long time to decide
the matter, I do not think that I have ever changed my
mind so often over any other question. In the end I decided
to give them to my friends.

I rode in to Nairobi on my favourite horse. Rouge, going
very slowly and looking round to the North, and the South.
It was a very strange thing to Rouge, I thought, to be going
in by the Nairobi road, and not to be coming back. I in-
stalled him, with some trouble, in the horse-van of the Nai-
vasha train, I stood in the van and felt, for the last time, his
silky muzzle against my hands and my face. I will not let
thee go, Rouge, except thou bless me. We had found to-
gether the riding-path dowm to the river amongst the Na-
tive shambas and huts, on the steep slippery descent he had
walked as nimbly as a mule, and in the brown running river-
water I had seen my own head and his close together. May
you now, in a valley of clouds, eat carnations to the right
and stock to the left.

The two young deerhounds that I had then, David and
Dinah, Pania’s offspring, I gave to a friend on a farm near
Gil-Gil, wdiere they would get good hunting. They were
very strong and playful, and when they were fetched in a
car and drove off from the farm in great style, they panted,
their heads close together over the side of the car, their
tongues hanging out, as if they were on the track of a new



OUT OF AFRICA

splendid kind of game. The quick eyes and feet, and the
live hearts, went away from the house and the plains, to
breathe and sniff, and run happily on new grounds.

Some of my people now left the farm. As there was to be
no coffee and no coffee-mill there any longer, Pooran Singh
found himself out of work. He did not want to take on an-
other job in Africa, and in the end he made up his mind to
go back to India.

Pooran Singh, who mastered the minerals, outside of his
workshop was like a child. He could not in the least realize
that the end of the farm had come; he grieved over it, wept
clear tears that ran down in his black beard, and for a long
time worried me with his attempts to make me remain on
the farm, and with his plans for keeping it going. He had
taken much pride in our machinery, such as it was, and was
now for a while as if nailed to the steam-engine and the
coffee-dryer in the factory, his soft dark eyes consuming
every nut in them. Then, when in the end he had been con-
vinced of the hopelessness of the situation, he gave it all up
in one movement, he was still very sad, but quite passive,
and sometimes when I saw him he talked much to me of his
travelling plans. When he went away, he carried no lug-
gage with him but a small box of tools and soldering outfit,
as if he had already sent his heart and life over the ocean,
and there was now only his thin, unassuming, brown person
and the soldering pan to follow it.

I wanted to give Pooran Singh a present before he left,
and I had hoped that I might have something in my posses-
sion which he would like, but when I spoke to him of it he
at once with great joy declared that he wanted a ring. I had
no ring and no money to buy him one. This had happened
already some months ago, at the time when Denys was com-
ing out to dine at the farm, and so at dinner I told him of



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

the position. Denys had once given me an Abyssinian ring
of soft gold, to be screwed on so that it would fit any fim
ger. He now thought that I was looking at it with the in-
tention of giving it to Pooran Singh, for he used to com-
plain that whenever he gave me anything I would at once
give it away to my coloured people. To prevent such a
thing happening, he took it from my hand and put it on his
own and said that he would keep it until Pooran Singh had
gone. It was a few days before he went to Mombasa, and
in this way the ring was buried with him. Before Pooran
Singh left I had, however, raised enough money by the sale
of my furniture to buy him the ring he wanted in Nairobi.
It was of heavy gold with a big red stone, that looked like
glass. Pooran Singh was so happy about it that he shed a
few tears again, and I believe that the ring helped him over
his final parting with the farm and with his machinery. For
his last week, he wore it every day, and whenever he came
to the house, he held up his hand, and showed it to me with
a radiant, gentle smile. At Nairobi station, the last thing
that I saw of him was this slim dark hand, that had worked
on the forge with such furious speed. It was stretched out
through the window of the crowded and overheated Native
railway carriage, in which Pooran Singh had placed him-
self upon his tool-box, and the red stone in it shone like a
little star while it went up and down, waving good-bye.

Pooran Singh went to the Punjab to his family. He had
not seen them for many years, but they had kept in touch
with him by sending him photographs of themselves, which
he preserved down in his little corrugated iron house by the
factory, and showed to me with great tenderness and pride.
I had several letters from Pooran Singh already from the
boat to India. They all began in the same way: “Dear

367



OUT OF AFRICA

Madam. Good-bye.” and then went on to give me his news
and to report on his adventures of the journey.

A week after Denys’s death one morning a strange thing
happened to me.

I lay in bed and thought of the events of the last months,
I tried to understand what it really was that had happened.
It seemed to me that I must have, in some way, got out of
the normal course of human existence, into a maelstrom
where I ought never to have been. Wherever I walked, the
ground fell away under me, and the stars fell from the sky.
I thought of the poem about Ragnarok, in which this fall of
the stars is described, and of the verses about the dwarfs
who sigh deeply in their caves in the mountains, and die
from fear. All this could not be, I thought, just a coinci-
dence of circumstances, what people call a run of bad luck,
but there must be some central principle within it. If I could
find it, it would save me. If I looked in the right place, I
reflected, the coherence of things might become clear to
me. I must, I thought, get up and look for a sign.

Many people think it an unreasonable thing, to be looking
for a sign. This is because of the fact that it takes a particu-
lar state of mind to be able to do so, and not many people
have ever found themselves in such a state. If in this mood,
you ask for a sign, the answer cannot fail you; it follows as
the natural consequence of the demand. In that same way
an inspired card-player collects thirteen chance cards on
the table, and takes up what is called a hand of cards— a
unity. Where others see no call at all, he sees a grand slam
staring him in the face. Is there a grand slam in the cards,^
Yes, to the right player.

I came out of the house looking for a sign, and wandered
at haphazard towards the boys’ huts. They had just let out



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


their chickens, which were running here and there amongst
the houses. I stood for a little while and looked at them.

Fathima’s big white cock came strutting up before me.
Suddenly he stopped, laid his head first on one side, and
then on the other, and raised his comb. From the other side
of the path, out of the grass, came a little grey Chameleon
that was, like the cock himself, out on his morning recon-
noitring. The cock walked straight upon it, —for the chick-
ens eat these things,— and gave out a few clucks of satisfac-
tion. The Chameleon stopped up dead at the sight of the
cock. He was frightened, but he was at the same time very
brave, he planted his feet in the ground, opened his mouth
as wide as he possibly could, and, to scare his enemy, in a
flash he shot out his club-shaped tongue at the cock. The
cock stood for a second as if taken aback, then swiftly and
determinately he struck down his beak like a hammer and
plucked out the Chameleon’s tongue.

The whole meeting between the two had taken ten sec-
onds. Now I chased off Fathima’s cock, took up a big stone
and killed the Chameleon, for he could not live without his
tongue; the Chameleons catch the insects that they feed on
with their tongue.

I was so frightened by what I had seen,— for it had been
a gruesome and formidable thing in a miniature format,—
that I went away and sat down on the stone seat by the
house. I sat there for a long time, and Farah brought me out
my tea, and put it on the table, I looked down on the stones
and dared not look up, such a dangerous place did the
world seem to me.

Very slowdy only, in the course of the next few days, it
came upon me that I had had the most spiritual answer pos-
sible to my call. I had even been in a strange manner hon-
oured and distinguished. The powers to which I had cried

^6q



OUT OF AFRICA

had stood on my dignity more than I had done myself, and
what other answer could they then give? This was clearly
not the hour for coddling, and they had chosen to connive
at my invocation of it. Great powers had laughed to me, '
with an echo from the hills to follow the laughter, they had
said among the trumpets, among the cocks and Chameleons,
Ha ha!

I was also pleased that I had been out this morning in
time to save the Chameleon from a slow, painful death.

It was about this time,— although it was before I had sent
away my horses,— that Ingrid Lindstrom came down from
her farm at Njoro to stay with me for a little while. This
was a friendly act of Ingrid’s, for it was difficult to her to
get away from her own farm. Her husband, to make money
to pay off their Njoro land, had taken a job with a big Sisal
company in Tanganyika, and was at the time sweating
down there at an altitude of two thousand feet, just as if In-
grid had been leasing him out in the quality of a slave, for
the sake of the farm. She was therefore, in the meantime,
running it on her own; she had extended her poultry yards,
and her market-garden, and had got pigs, and broods of
young turkeys up there, which she could ill afford to leave,
even for a few days. All the same, for my sake she gave it
all in charge of Kemosa, and rushed down to me as she
would run to the assistance of a friend whose house was on
fire, and she came without Kemosa this time, which was
probably, under the circumstances, a good thing for Farah.
Ingrid understood and realized to the bottom of her heart,
with great strength, with something of the strength of the
elements themselves, what it is really like, when a woman
farmer has to give up her farm, and leave it.

While Ingrid was staying with me, we did not discuss
370



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

either the pa<?t or the future, and did not mention the name
of a single friend or acquaintance, we closed our two minds
round the disaster of the hour. We walked together from
the one thing on the farm to the other, naming them as we
passed them, one by one, as if we were taking mental stock
of my loss, or as if Ingrid were, on my behalf, collecting
material for a book of complaints to be laid before destiny.
Ingrid knew well enough from her own experience that
there is no such book, but all the same the idea of it forms
part of the livelihood of women.

We went down to the oxen’s boma, and sat on the fence,
counting the oxen as they came in. Without words I pointed
them out to Ingrid: '‘These oxen,” and without words she
responded: "Yes, these oxen,” and recorded them in her
book. We went round to the stables to feed the horses with
sugar, and when they had finished it, I stretched out my
sticky and be-slabbered palms, presenting them to Ingrid
and crying, "These horses.” Ingrid sighed back laboriously,
"Yes, these horses,” and noted them down. In my garden by
the river she could not reconcile herself to the idea that I
must leave the plants that I had brought from Europe; she
wrung her hands over the mint, sage and lavender, and
talked of them again later on, as if she were pondering on
some scheme by which I might arrange to take them with
me.

We spent the afternoons in contemplation of my small
herd of Native cows w^hich grazed on the lawn. I went
through their age, characteristics, and yielding of milk, and
Ingrid groaned and shrieked over the figures as if she had
been bodily hurt. She scrutinized them carefully one by one,
not with any view to trade, for my cows were going to my
houseboys, but so as to value and weigh up my loss. She
clung to the soft sweet-smelling calves; she had herself after

371



OUT OF AFRICA

long struggles got a few cows with calves on her farm, and
against all reason, and against her own will, her deep furious
glances blamed me for deserting my calves.

A man who was walking beside a bereaved friend and
who was all the time in his own mind repeating the words:
'Thank God it is not me,” would, I believe, feel badly
about it, and would try to suppress the feeling. It is a differ-
ent thing in two women who are friends, and of whom the
one is manifesting her deep sympathy in the distress of the
other. There it goes without saying that the more fortunate
friend will all the while in her heart repeat the same thing:
‘Thank God it is not me.” It causes no bad feeling between
the two, but on the contrary brings them closer together,
and gives to the ceremony a personal element. Men, I think,
cannot easily or harmoniously envy or triumph over one
another. But it goes without saying that the bride triumphs
over the bridesmaids, and that the lying-in-visitors envy the
mother of the child; and none of the parties feel the worse
on that account. A woman who had lost a child, might
show its clothes to a friend, aware that the friend was re-
peating in her heart: ‘Thank God it is not me, ’’—and it would
be to both of them a natural and befitting thing. It was so
with Ingrid and me. As we walked over the farm, I knew
that she was thinking of her own farm, praising her luck
that it was still hers, and holding on to it with all her might,
and we got on very weU on that. In spite of bur old khaki
coats and trousers, we were in reality a pair of mythical
women, shrouded respectively in white and black, a unity,
the Genii of the farmer’s life in Africa.

After a few days Ingrid said good-bye to me, and went
up by the railway to Njoro.

I could no longer ride out, and my walks without the

372



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


dogs had become very silent and sedate, but I still had my
car, and I was glad to have her, for in these months I had
much to do.

The fate of my squatters weighed on my mind. As the
people who had bought the farm were planning to take up
the coffee-trees, and to have the land cut up and sold as
building-plots, they had no use for the squatters, and as
soon as the deal was through, they had given them all six
months’ notice to get off the farm. This to the squatters was
an unforeseen and bewildering determination, for they had
lived in the illusion that the land was theirs. Many of them
had been born on the farm, and others had come there as
small children with their fathers.

The squatters knew that in order to stay on the land they
had got to work for me one hundred and eighty days out
of each year, for which they were paid twelve shillings for
every thirty days; these accounts were kept at the office of
the farm. They also knew that they must pay the hut-tax
to the Government, of twelve shillings to a hut, a heavy
burden on a man, who with very little else in the world
would own two or three grass-huts,— according to the num-
ber of his wives, for a Kikuyu husband must give each of
his wives her own hut. My squatters had, from time to
time, been threatened to be turned off the farm for an of-
fence, so that they must in some way have felt that their
position was not entirely unassailable. The hut-tax they
much disliked, and when I collected it on the farm for the
Government, they gave me a great deal to do, and much
talk to listen to. But they had still looked upon these things
as common vicissitudes of life, and had never given up the
hope of somehow getting round them. They had not imag-
ined that there might be, to them all, an underlying univer-
sal principle, which would at its own hour manifest itself in



OUT OF AFRICA

a fatal, crushing manner. For some time they chose to re-
gard the decision of the new owners of the farm as a bug-
bear, which they could courageously ignore.

In some respects, although not in all, the white men fill in
the mind of the Natives the place that is, in the mind of the
white men, filled by the idea of God. I once had a contract
drawn up with an Indian timber-merchant, it contained the
words: an act of God. I was not familiar with the expres-
sion, and the lawyer who was drawing up the contract tried
to explain it to me.

“No, no Madam,” he said, “you have not quite caught the
meaning of the term. What is completely unforeseeable,
and not consonant with rule or reason, that is an act of
God.”

In the end, the certainty of their notice to quit brought
the squatters in dark groups to my house. They felt the de-
nunciation as a consequence of my departure from the farm,
—my own bad luck was growing, and was spreading over
them as well. They did not blame me for it, for that was
talked out between us; they asked me where they were to go.

I found it, in more than one way, difficult to answer them.
The Natives cannot, according to the law, themselves buy
any land, and there was not another farm that I knew of,
big enough to take them on as squatters. I told them that I
had myself been told when I had made inquiries in the mat-
ter, that they must go into the ICikuyu Reserve and find
land there. On that they again gravely asked me if they
should find enough unoccupied land in the Reserve to bring
all their cattle with them? And, they went on, would they
be sure all to find land in the same place, so that the people
from the farm should remain together, for they did not
want to be separated?

I was surprised that they should be so determined to stay

. ^74



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

together, for on the farm they had found it difficult to keep
peace, and had never had much good to say of one another.
Still, here they all came, the big swaggering cattle-owners like
Kathegu, Kaninu, and Mange, hand in hand, so to say, with
the humble unportioned workers of the soil like Waweru
and Chotha, who did not own so much as one goat; and
they were all filled with the same spirit, and as intent upon
keeping one another as on keeping their cows. I felt that
they were not only asking me for a place to live on, but
that they were demanding their existence of me.

It is more than their land that you take away from the
people, whose Native land you take. It is their past as well,
their roots and their identity. If you take away the things
that they have been used to see, and will be expecting to
see, you may, in a way, as well take their eyes. This applies
in a higher degree to the primitive people than to the civi-
lized, and animals again will wander back a long w^ay, and
go through danger and sufferings, to recover their lost iden-
tity, in the surroundings that they know.

The Masai when they were moved from their old coun-
try, North of the railway line, to the present Masai Re-
serve, took with them the names of their hills, plains and
rivers; and gave them to the hills, plains and rivers in the
new country. It is a bewildering thing to the traveller. The
Masai were carrying their cut roots with them as a medi-
cine, and were trying, in exile, to keep their past by a
formula.

Now, my squatters were clinging to one another from
the same instinct of self-preservation. If they were to go
away from their land, they must have people round them
who had known it, and so could testify to their identity.
Then they could still, for some years, talk of the geography
and the history of the farm, and what one had forgotten the



OUT OF AFRICA

other would remember. As it was, they were feeling the
shame of extinction falling on them.

“Go Msabu,” they said to me, “go for us to the Selikali,
and obtain from them that we may take all our cattle with
us to the new place, and that we shall all remain together
where we are going.”

With this began for me a long pilgrimage, or beggar’s
journey, which took up my last months in Africa.

On the Kikuyu’s errand I first went to the District Com-
missioners of Nairobi and Kiambu, then to the Native De-
partment and the Land Office, and in the end to the Gover-
nor, Sir Joseph Byrne, whom I had not met till then, for he
was only just out from England. In the end I forgot what
I went for. I was washed in and out as by the tide. Some-
times I had to stay for a whole day in Nairobi, or to go in
two or three times in a day. There were always a number
of squatters stationed by my house, when I came back, but
they never asked me for my news, they kept watch there in
order to communicate to me, by some Native magic, stamina
on the course.

The Government Officials were patient and obliging peo-
ple. The difficulties in the matter were not of their making:
it was really a problem to find, in the Kikuyu Reserve, an
unoccupied stretch of land big enough to take in the full
number of the people and their cattle.

Most of the Officials had been in the country for a long
time, and knew the Natives well. They would only vaguely
suggest the resource of making the Kikuyu sell out some
of their stock. For they knew that under no circumstances
would they do so, and by bringing their herds on to a place
that was too small for them, they would cause, in years to
come, endless trouble with their neighbours in the Reserve,
2^6



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


for other District Commissioners up there to go into, and
settle.

But when we came to the second request of the squatters,
that they should remain together, the people in authority
said that there was no real need for that.

“Oh reason not the need,” I thought, “our basest beggars
are in the poorest things superfluous”,— and so on. All my
life I have held that you can class people according to how
they may be imagined behaving to King Lear. You could
not reason with King Lear, any more than with an old Ki-
kuyu, and from the first he demanded too much of every-
body; but he was a king. It is true that the African Native
has not handed over his country to the white man in a mag-
nificent gesture, so that the case is in some ways different
from that of the old king and his daughters; the white men
took over the country as a Protectorate. But I bore in mind
that not very long ago, at a time that could still be remem-
bered, the Natives of the country had held their land undis-
puted, and had never heard of the white men and their laws.
Within the general insecurity of their existence the land to
them was stiU steadfast. Some of them were carried off by
the slave-traders and were sold at slave-markets, but some
of them always remained. Those who were taken away, in
their exile and thraldom all over the Eastern world, would
long back to the highlands, for that was their own land.
The old dark clear-eyed Native of Africa, and the old dark
clear-eyed Elephant,— they are alike; you see them standing
on the ground, weighty with such impressions of the world
around them as have been slowly gathered and heaped up in
their dim minds; they are themselves features of the land.
Either one of the two might find himself quite perplexed
by the sight of the great changes that are going on all round
him, and might ask you where he was, and you would have

to answer him in the words of Kent: “In your own king-
dom, Sir.”

In the end, just as I was beginning to feel that I must
drive in to Nairobi and back, and talk on in Government
Offices all my life, I was suddenly informed that my appli-
cation had been granted. The Government had agreed to
give out a piece of the Dagoretti Forest Reserve to the squat-
ters of my farm. Here they could form a settlement of their
own, not far from their old place, and after the disappear-
ance of the farm they could still preserve their faces and
their names, as a community.

The news of this decision was received on the farm with
deep silent emotion. It was impossible to tell from the faces
of the Kikuyu whether they had all the time had faith in
this issue of the case, or whether they had despaired of it.
As soon as it was settled, they immediately entered on a
course of multifarious complicated requests and proposi-
tions that I refused to deal with. They still stayed on by my
house, watching me in a novel way. Natives have such feel-
ing for, and faith in, fortune, that now, after our one suc-
cess, they may have begun to trust that all was going to be
well, and that I was to stay on the farm.

AlS for me myself, the settlement of the squatters’ fate was
a great appeasement to me. I have not often felt so con-
tented.

Then, after two or three days, the feeling came upon me
that my work in the country had been brought to an end,
and that now I might go. The coffee harvest on the farm
was finished, and the mill standing still, the house was
empty, the squatters had got their land. The rains were over,
and the new grass was already long on the plains and in the
hiUs.

The plan which I had formed in the beginning, to give in
^78



FAREWELL TO THE FARM

in all minor matters, so as to keep what was of vital impor-
tance to me, had turned out to be a failure. I had consented
to give away my possessions one by one, as a kind of ran-
som for my own life, but by the time that I had nothing
left, I myself was the lightest thing of all, for fate to get
rid of.

There was a full moon in those days, it shone into the
bare room and laid the pattern of the windows on the floor.
I thought that the moon might be looking in and wonder-
ing how long I meant to stay on, in a place from which
everything else had gone. “Oh no,” said the moon, “time
means very little to me.”

I would have liked to have stayed on until I could have
seen the squatters installed in their new place. But the sur-
veying of the land took time, and it was uncertain when
they would be able to move on to it.

At that time, it came to pass that the old men of the
neighboiirhood resolved to hold a Ngoma for me.

These Ngomas of the Ancients had been great functions
in the past, but now they were rarely danced, and during
all my time in Africa I have never seen one of them. I
should have liked to have done so, for the Kikuyu them-
selves thought highly of them. It was considered an honour
to the farm that the old men’s dance was to be performed
there, my people talked of it a long time before it was to
take place.

Even Farah, who generally looked down on the Native
Ngomas, was this time impressed by the resolution of the
old men. “These people are very old, Memsahib,” he said,
“very very old.”

It was curious to hear the young Kikuyu lions speak with
reverence and awe of the coining performance of the old
dancers.

There was one thing about these Ngomas of which I did
not know,-namely that they had been prohibited by the
Government. The reason for the prohibition I do not know.
The Kikuyu must have been aware of the interdiction, but
they chose to overlook it, either they reasoned that in these

great troubled times, things might be done that in ordinary
times could not be done, or else they really forgot about it
in the midst of the strong emotions set going by the dance.
They did not even have it in them to keep silent about the
Ngoma.

The old dancers when they arrived were a rare, sublime
sight. There were about a hundred of them, and they all
arrived at the same time, and must have collected some-
where at a distance from the house. The old Native men
are chilly people, and generally wrap and muffle themselves
up well in furs and blankets, but here they were naked, as if
solemnly stating the formidable truth. Their finery and war-
paint were discreetly put on, but a few of them wore, on
their old bald skulls, the big head-dresses of black eagle’s
feathers that you see on the heads of the young dancers.
They did not need any ornaments either, they were impres-
sive in themselves. They did not, like the old beauties of the
European ball-room, strive to obtain a youthful appearance,
the whole point and weight of the dance, to them them-
selves, and to the onlookers, lay in the old age of the per-
formers. They had a queer sort of markings on them, the
like of which I had never seen, chalked stripes running
along their crooked limbs as if they were, in their stark
truthfulness, emphasizing the stiff and brittle bones under-
neath the skin. Their movements, as they advanced in a
slow prelusive march were so strange that I wondered what
sort of dance I was now to be shown.

As I stood and looked at them a fancy came back to me
that had taken hold of me before: It w^as not I who was go-
ing away, I did not have it in my power to leave Africa,
but it was the country that was slowly and gravely with-
drawing from me, like the sea in ebb-tide. The procession
that was passing here,— it was in reality my strong pulpy

young dancers of yesterday and the day before yesterday,
who were withering before my eyes, who were passing
away for ever. They were going in their own style, gently,
in a dance, the people were with me, and I with the people,
well content.

The old men did not speak, not even to one another, they
were saving their strength for the coming efforts.

Just as the dancers had ranged themselves for the dance,
an Askari from Nairobi arrived at the house with a letter
for me, that the Ngoma must not take place.

I did not understand it, for it was to me a quite unlooked-
for thing, and I had to read the paper through twice or three
times. The Askari who had brought it, was himself so im-
pressed with the importance of the show he had upset, that
he did not open his mouth to the old people or to my house-
boys, nor strut or swagger in the usual manner of Askaris,
who are pleased to show off their plenitude of power to
other Natives.

During all my life in Africa I have not lived through an-
other moment of such bitterness. I had not before known
my heart to heave up in such a storm against the things
happening to me. It did not even occur to me to speak; the
nothingness of speech by now was manifest to me.

The old Kikuyu themselves stood like a herd of old sheep,
all their eyes under the wrinkled lids fixed upon my face.
They could not, in a second, give up the thing on which
their hearts had been set, some of them made little convulsive
movements with their legs; they had come to dance and
dance they must. In the end I told them that our Ngoma
was off.

The piece of news, I knew, would in their minds take on a
different aspect, but what I could not tell. Perhaps they
realized at once how completely the Ngoma was off, for the

reason that there was no longer anybody to dance to, since
I no longer existed. Perhaps they thought that it had, in real-
ity, already been held, a matchless Ngoma, of such force that
it made naught of everything else, and that, when it was
over, everything was over.

A small Native dog on the lawn profited by the stillness to
yap out loudly, and the echo ran through my mind:

. . the little dogs and all,

Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.”

Kamante, who had been put in charge of the tobacco that
was to have been dealt out to the Ancients after the dance,
in his habitual silent resourcefulness here thought the mo-
ment convenient for bringing it, and stepped forward with
a big calabash filled with snuff. Farah waved him back, but
Kamante was a Kikuyu, in understanding with the old danc-
ers, and he had his way. The snuff was a reality. We now
distributed it amongst the old men. After a little while they
ail walked away.

The people of the farm who grieved most at my departure
were I think the old women. The old Kikuyu women have
had a hard life, and have themselves become flint-hard under
it, like old mules which will bite you if they can come to it.
They were more difficult for any disease to kill off than
their men, as I learned in my practice as a doctor, and they
were wilder than the men, and, even more thoroughly than
they, devoid of the faculty of admiration. They had borne
a number of children and had seen many of them die; they
were afraid of nothing. They carried loads of firewood,—
with a rein round their foreheads to steady them,— of three
hundred pounds, tottering below them, but unsubdued; they

:i8:i

worked in the hard ground of their shambas, standing on
their heads from the early morning till late in the evening.
“From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold
afar off. Her heart is as firm as a stone, yea as hard as a piece
of the nether millstone. She mocketh at fear. What time she
lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his
rider. Will she make many supplications unto thee? will she
speak soft words unto thee?” And they had a stock of energy
in them still; they radiated vitality. The old women took a
keen interest in everything that was going on on the farm,
and would walk ten miles to look at an Ngoma of the young
people; a joke, or a cup of tembu, would make their wrin-
kled toothless faces dissolve in laughter. This strength, and
love of life in them, to me seemed not only highly respect-
able, but glorious and bewitching.

The old women of the farm and I had always been friends.
They were the people who called me Jerie; the men and the
children— except the very young— never used the name for
me. Jerie is a Kikuyu female name, but it has some special
quality,— whenever a girl is bom to a Kikuyu family a long
time after her brothers and sisters, she is named Jerie, and I
suppose that the name has a note of affection in it.

Now the old women were sorry that I was leaving them.
From this last time, I keep the picture of a Kikuyu woman,
nameless to me, for I did not know her well, she belonged,
I think, to Kathegu’s village, and was the wife or widow of
one of his many sons. She came towards me on a path on
the plain, carrying on her back a load of the long thin poles
which the Kikuyu use for constructing the roofs of their
huts,— with them this is women’s work. These poles may be
fifteen feet long; when the women carry them they tie
them together at the ends, and the tall conical burdens give
to the people underneath them, as you see them travelling

over the land, the silhouette of a prehistoric animal, or j.
Giraffe. The sticks which this woman was carrying were all
black and charred, sooted by the smoke of the hut during
many years; that meant that she had been pulling down her
house and was trailing her building materials, such as they
were, to new grounds. When we met she stood dead still,
barring the path to me, staring at me in the exact manner
of a Giraffe in a herd, that you will meet on the open plain,
and which lives and feels and thinks in a manner unknow-
able to us. After a moment she broke out weeping, tears
streaming over her face, like a cow that makes water on the
plain before you. Not a word did she or I myself speak,
and, after a few minutes, she ceded the way to me, and we
parted, and walked on in opposite directions. I thought that
after all she had some materials with which to begin her
new house, and I imagined how she would set to work, and
tie her sticks together, and make herself a roof.

The little herd-boys on the farm, who had never in their
lives known of a time when I had not been living in the
house, on the other hand had a great deal of excitement and
tension of suspense out of the idea that I was going away.
It may have been to them difficult, and daring, to imagine
the world without me in it, as if Providence had been known
to be abdicating. They rose to the surface of the long grass
when I was passing and cried out to me: “When are you
going away, Msabu? Msabu, in how many days are you go-
ing away?’’

When in the end, the day came on which I was going
away, I learned the strange learning that things can happen
which we ourselves cannot possibly imagine, either before-
hand, or at the time when they are taking place, or after-
wards when we look back on them. Circumstances can have

iL motive force by which they bring about events without
aid of human imagination or apprehension. On such occa-
sions you yourself keep in touch with what is going on by
attentively following it from moment to moment, like a
blind person who is being led, and who places one foot in
front of the other cautiously but unwittingly. Things are
happening to you, and you feel them happening, but except
for this one fact, you have no connection with them, and
no key to the cause or meaning of them. The performing
wild animals in a circus go through their programme, I be-
lieve, in that same way. Those who have been through such
events can, in a way, say that they have been through death,
—a passage outside the range of imagination, but within the
range of experience.

Gustav Mohr came out in his car in the early morning to
go in to the railway station with me. It was a cool morning
with but little colour in the air or the landscape. He himself
looked pale, and blinked, and I remembered what an old
Norwegian captain of a whaler down in Durban had ex-
plained to me, that the Norwegians are undismayed in any
storm, but their nervous system cannot stand a calm. We
had tea together on the millstone table, as we had had many
times before. Here, to the West, the Hills before us, with a
little floating grey mist in the creeks, lived gravely through
another moment of their many thousand years. I was very
cold as if I had been up there.

My house-boys were still in the empty house, but they
had, so to say, already moved their existence to other quar-
ters, their families and their belongings had been sent off.
Farah’s women, and Saufe, had gone to the Somali village
of Nairobi in a lorry the day before. Farah himself was go-
ing with me as far as Mombasa, and so was Juma’s young
son Tumbo, because he wanted to do so more than any-



FAREWELL TO THE FARM


thing else in the world, and when, as parting gift, he had
been given the choice between a cow and the journey to
Mombasa, he had chosen the journey.

I said good-bye to each of my house-boys, and, as I went
out, they, who had been carefully instructed to close the
doors, left the door wide open behind me. This was a typi-
cal Native gesture, as if they meant that I was to come back
again, or else they did so to emphasize that there was now
nothing more to close the doors of the house on, and they
might as well be open to all the winds. Farah was driving
me, slowly, at the pace of a riding-camel I suppose, round
by the drive and out of sight of the house.

As we came to the pond, I asked Mohr if we would not
have time to stop for a moment, and we got out, and smoked
a cigarette by the bank. We saw some fish in the water, which
were now to be caught and eaten by people who had not
known old Knudsen, and were not aware of the importance
of the fish themselves. Here Sirunga, my squatter Kaninu’s
small grandson, who was an epileptic, appeared to say a last
good-bye to me, for he had been round by the house to do
so, incessantly, for the last days. When we got into the cars
again and went off, he started to run after the cars as fast as
he could, as if whirled on in the dust by the wind, for he
was so small,— like the final little spark from my fire. He ran
all the way to where the farm-road joined the highroad, and
I was afraid that he might come with us on to the highroad
as well; it would have been then as if now all the farm were
scattered and blown about in husks. But he stopped up at
the corner, after all he did still belong to the farm. He stood
there and stared after us, as long as I could see the turning
of the farm-road.

On the way in to Nairobi, we saw a number of grass-
hoppers in the grass and on the road itself, a few whirred

?nto the car, it looked as if they were coming back upon
the country once more.

Many of my friends had come down to the station to see
me off. Hugh Martin was there, heavy and nonchalant, and
as he came and said good-bye to me, I saw my Doctor Pan-
gloss of the farm as a very lonely figure, a heroic figure,
who had bought his loneliness with everything he had, and
somehow an African symbol. We took a friendly leave: we
had had much fun together, and many wise talks. Lord Dela-
mere was a little older, a little whiter, and with his hair cut
shorter than when I had had tea with him in the Masai Re-
serve, when I came down there with my ox-transport, at the
beginning of the war, but as exceedingly and concernedly
courteous and polite now as then. Most of the Somalis of
Nairobi were on the platform. The old cattle-trader Ab-
dallah came up and gave me a silver ring with a turquoise in
it, to bring me luck. Bilea, Denys’s servant gravely asked me
to give his respects to his master’s brother in England, in
whose house he had stayed in the old days. The Somali
women, Farah told me on the way down in the train, had
been at the station in rickshas, but when they had seen so
many Somali men collected there, they had lost heart and
had just driven back.

Gustav Mohr and I shook hands when I was already in
the train. Now that the train was going to move, was al-
ready moving, he had got back his balance of mind. He
wished so strongly to impart courage to me that he blushed
deeply; his face was flammg and his light eyes shining at me.

At the Samburu station on the line, I got out of the train
while the engine was taking in water, and walked with
Farah on the platform.

From there, to the South-West, I saw the Ngong Hills.
